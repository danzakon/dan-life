## 1. Psychosis and Schizophrenia

### The Landmark Study: Di Forti et al. (2019) -- EU-GEI Multicentre Case-Control Study

- **Citation:** Di Forti M, Quattrone D, Freeman TP, et al. "The contribution of cannabis use to variation in the incidence of psychotic disorder across Europe (EU-GEI): a multicentre case-control study." *The Lancet Psychiatry*, 2019; 6(5): 427-436.
- **URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30902669/
- **Sample:** 901 patients with first-episode psychosis + 1,237 population controls across 11 sites in Europe and Brazil (May 2010 to April 2015)
- **Key findings:**
  - Daily cannabis use: **adjusted OR 3.2** (95% CI 2.2-4.1) for psychotic disorder vs. never users
  - Daily use of **high-potency cannabis** (THC >=10%): **adjusted OR 4.8** (95% CI 2.5-6.3) -- nearly 5x increased odds
  - **Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs):** If high-potency cannabis were no longer available, **12.2%** of first-episode psychosis cases could be prevented across all sites
  - In London specifically: if daily high-potency use were eliminated, **30.3%** of new psychosis cases could be prevented
  - In Amsterdam: **50.3%** of cases were attributable to high-potency daily use
  - The study found a **correlation between incidence rates of psychotic disorder and the proportion of daily high-potency cannabis users** across sites
- **Potency definition:** Low potency = THC <10%; High potency = THC >=10%

### Di Forti et al. (2015) -- South London Case-Control Study

- **Sample:** 410 patients with first-episode psychosis, 76% participation rate (461 of 606 approached)
- **Key findings:**
  - Patients with first-episode psychosis were more likely to have used cannabis daily
  - **No association** found between low-potency (hash) cannabis and psychosis, even with daily use
  - High-potency (skunk) cannabis: **OR 2.9** for any use, rising substantially for daily use
  - The effect was **strongly dependent on the type (potency) of cannabis used**, not just frequency

- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6349031/ | https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037687161730220X
- **Sample:** 42 healthy volunteers, randomized double-blind
- **Design:** Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) after receiving 0mg, 7.5mg, or 12.5mg oral THC
- **Key findings -- the definitive biphasic demonstration:**
  - **7.5 mg THC:** Dampened negative emotional responses to stress **without influencing performance** -- anxiolytic effect
  - **12.5 mg THC:** Slightly but significantly **increased negative affect overall** -- anxiogenic effect
  - **12.5 mg THC also impaired TSST performance** and attenuated blood pressure responses
  - Demonstrates a **nonlinear (inverted U-shaped) dose-response curve** for THC and anxiety

### Zuardi et al. (2017) -- CBD Inverted U-Shaped Dose-Response

- **Citation:** Zuardi AW, Rodrigues NP, Silva AL, et al. "Inverted U-Shaped Dose-Response Curve of the Anxiolytic Effect of Cannabidiol during Public Speaking in Real Life." *Frontiers in Pharmacology*, 2017; 8: 259.
- **URL:** https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2017.00259/pdf
- **Key finding:** CBD also shows an inverted U-shaped dose-response for anxiety relief during public speaking -- moderate doses are optimal; too high reduces the anxiolytic benefit

### Lichenstein (2023) -- THC, CBD, and Anxiety Review

- **Citation:** Lichenstein SD. "THC, CBD, and Anxiety: A review of recent findings on the anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of cannabis' primary cannabinoids."
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10722902/

  - THC: anxiolytic at low doses, anxiogenic at high doses (biphasic)
  - CBD: generally anxiolytic, but also shows an inverted U-curve
  - Individual differences in response are significant

### Aparisi Rey et al. (2012) -- Biphasic Mechanism: CB1 and GABA

- **Citation:** Aparisi Rey A, Purrio M, et al. "Biphasic Effects of Cannabinoids in Anxiety Responses: CB1 and GABAB Receptors in the Balance of GABAergic and Glutamatergic Neurotransmission." *Neuropsychopharmacology*, 2012; 37(12): 2624-2634.
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3473327/
- **Key mechanism:**
  - Low cannabinoid doses preferentially activate **CB1 receptors on glutamatergic terminals** --> reduced glutamate --> anxiolytic
  - High doses activate **CB1 receptors on GABAergic terminals** --> reduced GABA (the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter) --> net excitation --> anxiogenic
  - The balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission at CB1 receptors explains the paradox

  - Good tolerability across all groups
  - High dropout/crossover rates and methodological challenges (difficulty maintaining blinding with smoked cannabis)
  - The study was considered inconclusive rather than definitively negative

- **URL:** https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-023-07543-2
- **Sample:** Only **5 individuals completed** the trial
- **Design:** Randomized placebo-controlled cross-over (3 conditions)
- **Key findings:**
  - Results identified positive changes consistent with **medium-sized within-subject effects** for cannabis in treating PTSD
  - High patient interest and retention
  - **Too small to draw firm conclusions** -- analysis of placebo effect not possible
  - Used a commercially available chemovar delivered by vaporization (more generalizable)

- **Citation:** Hill ML, Kline AC, Saraiya TC, et al. "Cannabis use and trauma-focused treatment for co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders: A meta-analysis of individual patient data." *Journal of Anxiety Disorders*, 2024; 102: 102827.
- **URL:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618524000033
- **Key finding:** Treatment outcomes for PTSD+SUD are **similar for those with and without cannabis use** -- meaning cannabis use doesn't appear to derail evidence-based PTSD treatment, but trauma-focused therapy outperforms non-trauma-focused treatment regardless

## Summary Table: Strength of Evidence by Area

| Area | Direction of Effect | Strength of Evidence | Key Risk Multiplier |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Psychosis/Schizophrenia | Cannabis increases risk | **Strong** (multiple large studies, dose-response, biological plausibility) | OR 3.2 (daily use); OR 4.8 (daily high-potency) |
| Depression | Cannabis modestly increases risk; bidirectional | **Moderate** (consistent but modest effect sizes, confounding hard to eliminate) | OR 1.37 (adolescent use) |
| Anxiety | Biphasic: low dose helps, high dose harms | **Moderate** (well-demonstrated in experimental studies) | Dose-dependent: 7.5mg THC reduces; 12.5mg THC increases |
| Cannabis Use Disorder | Cannabis causes dependence in subset of users | **Strong** (well-established epidemiologically) | ~30% of users develop CUD; 4-7x risk if onset <18 |
| Suicidality | Cannabis associated with increased risk | **Moderate-Strong** (large samples, consistent across studies, but causality unclear) | OR 3.46 (suicide attempt, adolescents); 3x suicidal ideation in daily users vs. non-users |
| PTSD Treatment | Insufficient evidence of efficacy | **Weak/Insufficient** (only 1 RCT, failed to beat placebo; very small trials) | No demonstrated treatment effect above placebo |
