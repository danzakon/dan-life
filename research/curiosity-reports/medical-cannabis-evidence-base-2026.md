## 1. Chronic Pain

**Evidence Strength: MODERATE -- real but modest effect**

This is the most-studied indication and the one most commonly cited as justification for medical cannabis. The evidence supports a real but small effect -- much smaller than advocates claim.

### Key Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses

**Stockings et al. (2018) -- Pain. 159(10):1932-1954**
- 47 RCTs, 57 observational studies (n=9,958 total)
- Pooled event rates for 30% pain reduction: 29.0% (cannabinoids) vs 25.9% (placebo)
- **NNT = 24** (number needed to treat -- you must treat 24 patients for one additional person to achieve 30% pain relief beyond placebo)
- **NNH = 6** (number needed to harm -- 1 in 6 patients experiences an adverse event)
- This is a terrible NNT/NNH ratio. For comparison: gabapentin for neuropathic pain has NNT ~7, pregabalin NNT ~7, SNRIs NNT ~7
- Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29847469/

**Wang et al. (2021) -- BMJ. 374:n1034** (the most rigorous recent meta-analysis)
- 32 RCTs with 5,174 adult patients
- Medical cannabis vs placebo for chronic pain
- Pain relief: weighted mean difference (WMD) of **-0.50 cm on a 10 cm VAS** (95% CI: -0.75 to -0.25, moderate certainty)
- This means roughly a **5% improvement** on the pain scale -- below the 1 cm threshold typically considered the minimally important difference (MID)
- Physical functioning: WMD of 1.67 points on the 100-point SF-36 (MID = 10 points). A very small improvement.
- Sleep quality: WMD of -0.35 cm on 10 cm VAS (high certainty). Small but consistent.
- Key quote: "non-inhaled medical cannabis or cannabinoids results in a **small to very small** improvement in pain relief, physical functioning, and sleep quality"
- Source: https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1034

**Fisher et al. (2021) -- PAIN. 162(Suppl 1):S45-S66** (Cochrane-affiliated)
- Concluded evidence for cannabinoids in chronic pain has "limited benefit"
- Source: https://journals.lww.com/pain/fulltext/2021/07001/cannabinoids,_cannabis,_and_cannabis_based.5.aspx

**Allan et al. (2018) -- Canadian Family Physician. 64(2):e78-e94** (Systematic review of systematic reviews)
- Compiled NNT data across multiple meta-analyses:
  - Whiting et al. (2015): 30% pain reduction, OR 1.41 (0.99-2.00), NNT ~19 (not statistically significant)
  - Stockings et al. (2018): NNT = 24
- Source: https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5964405/

**Inhaled Cannabis for Neuropathic Pain -- Andreae et al. (2015)**
- Meta-analysis of individual patient data from 5 RCTs
- Inhaled cannabis showed better results for neuropathic pain specifically
- But trials were small, short-duration (days to weeks), and at high risk of bias due to difficulty blinding smoked cannabis
- Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590015008123

### Critical Assessment

The pain evidence tells a consistent story: cannabis provides real but clinically small pain relief. The effect sizes are:
- Below the minimally important difference for most outcomes
- Worse than standard analgesics (NNT 24 vs NNT 7 for gabapentin/pregabalin)
- Accompanied by a high rate of side effects (NNH = 6)

However, the picture is nuanced:
- Neuropathic pain may respond better than other pain types
- Cannabis may have an opioid-sparing role (allowing lower opioid doses)
- For patients who have failed other treatments, even small improvements matter
- The "real world" effect may differ from RCT results due to patient selection and expectation effects

### Where It Fits

Cannabis for chronic pain is roughly comparable to acetaminophen in effect size -- real but modest. It is not a first-line analgesic and should not replace proven treatments. It may have a role as an adjunct, particularly for neuropathic pain, in patients who have failed standard treatments.

## 2. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV)

**Evidence Strength: STRONG for historical context, but LARGELY SUPERSEDED by modern antiemetics**

### FDA-Approved Cannabinoids

| Drug | Active Ingredient | FDA Approved | Indication |
|------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| Dronabinol (Marinol) | Synthetic THC | 1985 | CINV refractory to standard antiemetics |
| Nabilone (Cesamet) | Synthetic THC analogue | 1985 | CINV refractory to standard antiemetics |

### The Evidence

**Cochrane Reviews and Systematic Reviews:**
- Cannabinoids are superior to placebo and to older antiemetics (e.g., prochlorperazine, metoclopramide) for CINV
- Patients are more likely to achieve complete absence of nausea/vomiting with cannabinoids vs placebo
- Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535430/

**The Critical Context: Modern Antiemetics Have Surpassed Cannabinoids**

The ASCO 2020 Antiemetic Guidelines represent the current standard of care. Modern triple/quadruple therapy regimens include:
- 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron)
- NK1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant)
- Dexamethasone
- Olanzapine (for highly emetogenic chemotherapy)

These modern combinations achieve complete response rates of 70-90% for highly emetogenic chemotherapy -- far better than cannabinoids alone. Dronabinol and nabilone are now positioned as:
- **Breakthrough/rescue therapy** after failure of standard antiemetics
- **Not first-line treatment** for CINV
- Source: https://www.guidelinecentral.com/guideline/7395/

**Meiri et al. (2007) -- Current Medical Research and Opinion. 23(3):533-43**
- Compared dronabinol alone, dronabinol + ondansetron, and ondansetron alone for delayed CINV
- Dronabinol was NOT superior to ondansetron
- Combination showed modest benefit for complete response in delayed CINV
- Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17355735/

**Dronabinol for Refractory CINV -- May & Glode (2016)**
- Review of dronabinol use specifically in patients who failed standard antiemetics
- Found utility as a rescue agent, particularly for delayed and anticipatory nausea
- Nausea is often harder to control than vomiting, and cannabinoids may have a niche here
- Source: https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869612/

### Critical Assessment

The cannabinoid antiemetic story is historically important but clinically dated. When dronabinol and nabilone were approved in 1985, the alternatives were primitive. Today, they occupy a narrow niche as backup therapy. They are inferior to modern 5-HT3/NK1 antagonist regimens as monotherapy. Their main remaining value is:
- Rescue therapy after standard antiemetics fail
- Potential benefit for delayed nausea (24+ hours after chemo)
- Appetite stimulation as a secondary benefit in cancer patients
- Patient preference in some cases

## 3. Epilepsy (Epidiolex / Cannabidiol)

**Evidence Strength: STRONG -- FDA-approved with rigorous Phase 3 trial data**

This is the cleanest evidence story in all of cannabis medicine. It involves **cannabidiol (CBD)**, not THC, delivered as a pharmaceutical-grade oral solution.

### Epidiolex (cannabidiol) -- FDA-Approved 2018

**Approved indications (patients age 1+):**
- Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)
- Dravet syndrome
- Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) -- added later

Source: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/210365s021lbl.pdf

### Key Clinical Trial Data

**Dravet Syndrome -- Devinsky et al. (2017) -- NEJM. 376:2011-2020**
- Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 120 patients (children and young adults)
- CBD 20 mg/kg/day vs placebo, added to existing antiseizure medications
- Median convulsive seizure frequency: **38.9% reduction** (CBD) vs **13.3% reduction** (placebo). p=0.01
- 43% of CBD patients achieved >50% seizure reduction vs 27% on placebo
- 5% of CBD patients became seizure-free vs 0% on placebo
- Adverse events: somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes
- Source: https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611618

**Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome -- Devinsky et al. (2018) -- NEJM. 378:1888-1897**
- Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 225 patients
- CBD 20 mg/kg/day vs 10 mg/kg/day vs placebo
- Median drop-seizure reduction: **41.9%** (20 mg), **37.2%** (10 mg) vs **17.2%** (placebo). p=0.005
- Both CBD doses significantly better than placebo
- Source: https://nyulangone.org/news/cannabidiol-significantly-reduces-seizures-patients-severe-form-epilepsy

**Long-term Open-Label Extension -- Laux et al. (2019)**
- Extended follow-up of Dravet and LGS patients
- Sustained seizure reduction over years of treatment
- Acceptable long-term safety profile with liver monitoring
- Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022635/

**3-Year Open-Label Data (Jazz Pharmaceuticals, 2025)**
- Presented at American Epilepsy Society 2025 meeting
- Continued efficacy over 3 years for both LGS and Dravet
- Real-world evidence corroborating clinical trial findings
- Source: https://investor.jazzpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jazz-pharmaceuticals-present-extensive-new-data-and-real-world

### Critical Assessment

Epidiolex is a genuine pharmaceutical success story with rigorous evidence:
- Multiple large, well-designed Phase 3 RCTs
- Published in the New England Journal of Medicine
- FDA-approved through the standard NDA pathway (not a special cannabis pathway)
- For patients with devastating, drug-resistant childhood epilepsies

Important caveats:
- This is **CBD, not THC** -- it does not produce intoxication
- This is a **pharmaceutical-grade product**, not dispensary CBD oil
- Efficacy is proven only for LGS, Dravet, and TSC -- not general epilepsy
- Requires liver monitoring (elevated transaminases in 13% of patients)
- The NAS 2017 report found "no or insufficient evidence" for cannabinoids in general epilepsy -- Epidiolex trials were published AFTER that report

## 4. Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity (Nabiximols/Sativex)

**Evidence Strength: MODERATE -- approved in 30+ countries but NOT in the US**

### The Product

Nabiximols (Sativex) is an oromucosal spray containing THC (2.7 mg) and CBD (2.5 mg) per spray, derived from whole-plant cannabis. It is approved in over 30 countries (including UK, Germany, Canada, Australia) for MS-related spasticity that has not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medications. It has NOT been approved by the FDA.

### Key Evidence

**Wade et al. (2010) -- Meta-analysis -- Multiple Sclerosis. 16(6):707-14**
- Pooled data from multiple Sativex RCTs
- Sativex was associated with a statistically significant improvement in patient-reported spasticity on the NRS (0-10 scale)
- Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20558502/

**Novotna et al. (2011) -- Enriched-design RCT -- Eur J Neurol. 18(9):1122-31**
- Used an enriched design: 4-week trial phase, then only responders (>20% NRS improvement) randomized
- During the trial phase, ~42% of patients met the responder threshold
- Among responders, Sativex maintained significantly better spasticity scores vs placebo
- Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21362108/

**Scottish Medicines Consortium (2022) Assessment**
- Reviewed 4 Phase III/IV studies
- Sativex associated with greater improvement in patient-reported NRS scores and response rates vs placebo
- Accepted for use in NHSScotland with the enriched-design requirement (initial trial of therapy to identify responders)
- Source: https://scottishmedicines.org.uk/media/7097/delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinod-sativex-final-aug-2022-for-website.pdf

**Cochrane Review -- Filippini et al. (2022)**
- "Treatment with nabiximols likely results in improvement of spasticity and may not increase serious harmful effects compared with placebo"
- Source: https://cochrane.org/evidence/CD013444_cannabis-and-cannabinoids-people-multiple-sclerosis

**Azadvari et al. (2024) -- Systematic Review & Meta-analysis**
- Confirmed nabiximols as an efficient add-on treatment for MS spasticity refractory to standard treatment
- Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11536376/

### Critical Assessment

The evidence for Sativex in MS spasticity is legitimate but has important nuances:
- The enriched design means the drug works well for a **subgroup** (~40% of patients who respond in the trial phase)
- For the broader MS spasticity population, the NNT is likely much higher
- The effect is on **patient-reported** spasticity -- clinician-measured (objective) spasticity shows less consistent improvement
- It is approved as **add-on therapy** for refractory cases, not first-line
- The NAS 2017 report rated this as "conclusive or substantial evidence" for patient-reported symptoms but noted the objective measurement gap

## 5. Neuroprotection in Older Adults

**Evidence Strength: WEAK/PRECLINICAL -- fascinating animal data, almost no human evidence**

### The Key Animal Study

**Bilkei-Gorzo et al. (2017) -- Nature Medicine. 23:782-787**
- University of Bonn + Hebrew University of Jerusalem
- Mice aged 12 and 18 months given chronic low-dose THC (3 mg/kg/day)
- Old THC-treated mice performed as well as young (2-month) untreated mice on learning and memory tasks
- THC treatment restored hippocampal gene transcription patterns -- expression profiles of 12-month-old treated mice closely resembled 2-month-old untreated mice
- Enhanced expression of synaptic marker proteins and increased hippocampal spine density
- Effects were dependent on glutamatergic CB1 receptors and histone acetylation
- The rationale: endocannabinoid system activity naturally declines with aging; low-dose THC may restore CB1 signaling
- Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28481360/ / https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4348

### Follow-Up Work

**Shapira et al. (2023) -- Frontiers in Neuroscience**

**Weinstein & Sznitman (2020) -- Ageing Research Reviews**
- Review of implications of late-life cannabis use on brain health
- Key finding: "The detrimental effects of early-life cannabis use may not translate to use in older ages"
- Cannabis use in older ages "may be" associated with improved brain health
- Current evidence is "only suggestive"
- Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568163719303204

### Critical Assessment

This is the most speculative area in this report. The theoretical basis is compelling:

```
Young brain: Active endocannabinoid system → normal cognition
Aging brain: Declining endocannabinoid system → cognitive decline
Low-dose THC: Restores CB1 signaling → potentially reverses age-related decline
```

But the evidence chain has massive gaps:
- Animal model results (even dramatic ones) frequently fail to translate to humans
- The single small human Alzheimer's study is far from conclusive
- Cross-sectional observational data cannot establish causation
- No large RCTs in humans exist
- Risk of THC side effects in elderly (falls, confusion, cardiovascular events) is real
- The NAS 2017 report found "limited evidence that cannabinoids are ineffective for improving symptoms associated with dementia"

**Bottom line:** Scientifically interesting hypothesis with strong animal data. Essentially zero clinical evidence to guide human use. Do not extrapolate mouse data to human treatment decisions.

## 6. What DOESN'T Have Good Evidence (Despite Popular Belief)

### Glaucoma

**Evidence: INSUFFICIENT / INEFFECTIVE**

This is perhaps the oldest cannabis-medicine myth, dating to 1970s studies showing marijuana transiently lowers intraocular pressure (IOP).

**Why it doesn't work:**
- Cannabis does lower IOP, but only for **3-4 hours** per dose
- Glaucoma requires 24/7 IOP control -- you'd need to smoke every 3-4 hours around the clock
- The IOP-lowering effect is modest compared to standard treatments
- Cannabis also lowers blood pressure, which can reduce blood flow to the optic nerve -- potentially **worsening** glaucoma
- CBD may actually **raise** IOP
- Source: https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/medical-marijuana-glaucoma-treament

**Official positions:**
- American Academy of Ophthalmology: "does not recommend marijuana or other cannabis products for the treatment of glaucoma"
- American Glaucoma Society: "marijuana's side effects and short duration of action, coupled with a lack of evidence that its use alters the course of glaucoma, preclude recommending this drug in any form"
- Source: https://www.ophthalmologyweb.com/1315-News/164870-American-Academy-Of-Ophthalmology-Reiterates-Position-That-Marijuana-Is-Not-Proven-Treatment-For-Glaucoma/
- Source: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41452373_American_Glaucoma_Society_Position_Statement_Marijuana_and_the_Treatment_of_Glaucoma

**NAS 2017:** "Limited evidence that cannabinoids are **ineffective** for improving intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma."

### Cancer Treatment (Anti-Tumor Effects)

**Evidence: INSUFFICIENT -- in-vitro and animal data only, no human clinical evidence**

This claim is pervasive online but represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the evidence.

**What exists:**
- In-vitro studies showing cannabinoids can kill cancer cells in petri dishes
- Some animal models showing tumor growth reduction
- Zero completed human clinical trials demonstrating anti-tumor effects

**What authoritative bodies say:**
- NCI (National Cancer Institute): "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved Cannabis as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition"
- Cancer Research UK: Many substances kill cancer cells in a dish (including bleach). Petri dish results do not predict clinical efficacy.
- ASCO 2024 Guideline (Braun et al.): Focused on symptom management, not anti-tumor effects. No recommendation for cannabis as anti-cancer treatment.
- Source: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq
- Source: https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2022/05/13/cannabis-cannabinoids-and-cancer-the-evidence-so-far/
- Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38478773/

**NAS 2017:** "No or insufficient evidence to support or refute the conclusion that cannabinoids are an effective treatment for cancers, including glioma."

### Anxiety Relief

**Evidence: WEAK and PARADOXICAL**

This is one of the most commonly cited reasons for cannabis use, yet the evidence is deeply complicated.

**The paradox:**
- **Low doses** of THC appear anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing)
- **High doses** of THC are anxiogenic (anxiety-causing)
- CBD may be anxiolytic via 5-HT1A receptor activity, but clinical evidence is limited
- Chronic cannabis use is associated with **increased** anxiety disorder incidence

**Meta-analytic evidence (Beletsky et al. 2024):**
- Cannabis use associated with anxiety: OR = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.06-1.45, p=0.006; N=15 studies)
- Cannabis use disorder associated with anxiety: OR = 1.68 (95% CI: 1.23-2.31, p=0.001; N=13 studies)
- Best-fit model: self-medication hypothesis (anxiety drives cannabis use, not the reverse)
- Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10890807/

**Xue et al. (2020) -- Meta-analysis of longitudinal studies**
- Cannabis use associated with prospective long-term development of anxiety
- Source: https://realmofcaring.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/xue-et-al-2020-cannabis-use-and-prospective-long-term-association-with-anxiety-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-1.pdf

**NAS 2017 findings:**
- Limited evidence CBD improves anxiety symptoms (assessed by public speaking test, social anxiety only)
- Limited evidence cannabis use increases incidence of social anxiety disorder
- Limited evidence of increased anxiety symptoms with near-daily use
- Source: https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/24625/Cannabis_committee_conclusions.pdf

**Bottom line:** People use cannabis for anxiety, and acute low-dose use may provide short-term relief. But the longitudinal data suggest regular use is associated with worsening anxiety. This is consistent with a self-medication cycle rather than effective treatment.

### Sleep Aid

**Evidence: WEAK -- low-quality studies, tolerance concerns, rebound insomnia**

**What exists:**
- NAS 2017 found "moderate evidence" that cannabinoids improve short-term sleep -- but only in conditions with underlying pain/spasticity (obstructive sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, MS). The sleep improvement may be secondary to symptom relief, not a direct sleep effect.
- THC reduces sleep latency (time to fall asleep) acutely
- THC suppresses REM sleep (dreaming sleep)
- Tolerance develops rapidly -- requiring escalating doses
- Cessation causes rebound insomnia, often worse than baseline
- Source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40263-020-00773-x

**Bhagavan et al. (2020) -- CNS Drugs -- Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis**
- Evaluated cannabinoids specifically for insomnia disorder
- Found very few high-quality RCTs
- Highlighted lack of long-term safety data
- Source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40263-020-00773-x

**Recent developments (2025):**
- New meta-analysis in Sleep Medicine Reviews found THC/CBN formulations (but not CBD alone) associated with improvements in self-reported sleep quality
- Only 6 RCTs with 1,077 participants -- still limited evidence
- Source: https://www.cannabissciencetech.com/view/thc-cbn-for-sleep-new-study-finds-non-cbd-cannabis-formulations-may-improve-sleep-quality

**Key problems:**
- Most studies are short-term (weeks)
- Tolerance and dependence concerns with nightly THC use
- Rebound insomnia upon cessation is well-documented
- Cannabis suppresses REM sleep, which has cognitive and emotional processing functions
- CBD alone does not appear to improve sleep
- No comparison with proven sleep treatments (CBT-I, which has NNT ~2-3)

## Summary: The Honest Picture

```
EVIDENCE STRENGTH SPECTRUM FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS
=========================================================================

STRONG EVIDENCE (proven, FDA-approved, large RCTs)
  |
  |-- Epidiolex for Dravet/LGS/TSC epilepsy (CBD, not THC)
  |-- Dronabinol/nabilone for chemo nausea (but superseded by modern drugs)
  |
MODERATE EVIDENCE (real but modest effects)
  |
  |-- Chronic pain (small effect, NNT=24, unfavorable NNT/NNH ratio)
  |-- MS spasticity with Sativex (works for ~40% subgroup)
  |-- Short-term sleep improvement (secondary to pain/spasticity relief)
  |
WEAK EVIDENCE (promising but unproven)
  |
  |-- Anxiety relief (paradoxical -- may worsen with chronic use)
  |-- Sleep aid (tolerance, REM suppression, rebound insomnia)
  |-- PTSD (very limited trial data)
  |-- Neuroprotection in aging (strong animal data, no human evidence)
  |
INSUFFICIENT/NO EVIDENCE
  |
  |-- Cancer treatment/anti-tumor effects
  |-- Glaucoma (specifically found likely ineffective)
  |-- Depression treatment
  |-- Most neurological conditions (Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's)

=========================================================================

### The Gap Between Public Perception and Evidence

The most striking finding across this research is the enormous gap between what people believe cannabis can do and what the evidence actually supports. Most state medical cannabis qualifying conditions in the US are approved based on limited or no evidence of effectiveness:

- Stains et al. (2025) compared state qualifying conditions to NAS evidence levels: in 2024, only 8.3% of all state-approved qualifying conditions across the US had substantial evidence supporting their use with cannabis
- Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11891685/

### The Umbrella Review (Solmi et al. 2023 -- BMJ)

This massive umbrella review of meta-analyses from both RCTs and observational studies found:
- Most purported benefits of cannabinoids were supported by weak or very weak evidence
- The strongest therapeutic evidence: chronic pain, MS spasticity, CINV (consistent with NAS)
- Several harms had stronger evidence bases than the purported benefits
