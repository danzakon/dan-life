## 6. Immune System Effects

### Summary of the Evidence Landscape
The evidence on cannabis and immune function is complex and often contradictory. Most findings come from animal models or in vitro studies. Human clinical data is limited but growing.

### Hirota et al. (2023) -- Cannabis Smoke & Influenza (Animal Study)
- **Published:** ERJ Open Research, November 2023
- **Design:** Animal study (BALB/c mice), daily cannabis smoke exposure + influenza A virus

  - Infection-induced upregulation of certain inflammatory mediators (IFN-gamma, CCL chemokines) was suppressed
  - Cannabis did NOT disrupt antiviral responses identically to cigarette smoke -- distinct patterns
  - Both male and female mice affected
- **Implication:** Cannabis smoke may impair the lungs' ability to fight viral infections, but through different mechanisms than tobacco

## 7. Sleep

### Velzeboer et al. (2025) -- Definitive Meta-analysis of Sleep Architecture
- **Published:** Sleep Medicine Reviews, December 2025
- **Design:** Systematic review and meta-analysis of polysomnographic (PSG) studies
- **Sample:** 18 studies identified, 9 suitable for meta-analysis
- **KEY FINDINGS (challenges conventional wisdom):**
  - Cannabis administration **does not consistently alter** sleep duration, latency, wake time, efficiency, or sleep staging
  - **Early studies** suggesting REM sleep reduction were primarily based on **small-scale trials with high THC doses and significant methodological limitations**
  - **More recent studies** using larger samples and lower therapeutic THC doses have reported **mixed (and often no) evidence of REM suppression**
  - The widely-cited claim that "THC suppresses REM sleep" may be overstated based on current evidence

### Bolla et al. (2008) -- Johns Hopkins, Heavy Users
- **Published:** Sleep, June 2008
- **Design:** Polysomnographic study of heavy marijuana users
- **Author:** Karen I. Bolla, PhD (Johns Hopkins)
- **Focus:** Sleep disturbance patterns in chronic heavy users
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2442418/

### Kolla & Hayes (2022) -- Mayo Clinic Review
- **Published:** Journal of Primary Care & Community Health, April 2022
- **Key synthesis:**
  - THC may decrease sleep onset latency (fall asleep faster)
  - THC may increase slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) acutely
  - THC may suppress REM sleep acutely (but see Velzeboer 2025 challenging this)
  - With chronic use, tolerance develops to sleep-promoting effects
  - **Cannabis withdrawal causes significant sleep disruption:** insomnia, decreased sleep time, decreased sleep efficiency, shorter REM latency, increased REM rebound
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036386/

### Kaul et al. (2021) -- Neurotherapeutics Review
- **Published:** Neurotherapeutics, February 2021
- **Key points:**
  - Acute THC: may reduce time to fall asleep, may increase SWS
  - Chronic THC: tolerance to sleep-promoting effects
  - Withdrawal: significant sleep disruption, REM rebound (vivid dreams)
  - CBD: at higher doses may have sleep-promoting properties independent of THC
  - The endocannabinoid system plays a role in sleep-wake regulation
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8116407/

### Suraev et al. (2025) -- Pilot RCT, Macquarie University / University of Sydney
- **Published:** Journal of Sleep Research, July 2025
- **Design:** Pilot randomised controlled trial, high-density EEG in insomnia patients
- **Intervention:** Single oral dose of 10 mg THC + CBD
- **Focus:** Acute effects on sleep architecture and next-day function in people with insomnia
- **Key finding:** Effects on sleep architecture and next-day function remain poorly understood even in controlled settings

### Brown & Filbey (2025) -- UT Dallas, Cannabis + Chronic Pain + Sleep
- **Published:** medRxiv, August 2025
- **Design:** In-home EEG recordings
- **Key point:** Cannabis influences both pain and sleep through endocannabinoid system modulation; effects of cannabis and chronic pain on sleep architecture are typically studied in isolation but interact
- **URL:** https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.28.25334662v1.full-text

### Diep et al. (2022) -- NHANES Population Analysis
- **Published:** Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine, February 2022
- **Design:** Population analysis of NHANES 2005-2018
- **Focus:** Recent cannabis use and nightly sleep duration
- **URL:** https://rapm.bmj.com/content/47/2/100

### French i-Share Cohort (2023) -- University Students
- **Published:** ScienceDirect, 2023
- **Sample:** n = 14,787 French students aged 18-30
- **Key findings:**
  - 5.8% used cannabis weekly or daily
  - Cannabis users had **45% higher likelihood of insomnia** compared to non-users (adjusted)
  - **Daily users had 2.0-fold higher likelihood of insomnia** compared to never/rarely users
  - Similar patterns for sleepiness, poor sleep quality, and sleep deprivation

### College Student Daily Diary Study (2023)
- **Published:** Research in Sports Medicine Journal, November 2023
- **Sample:** n = 337 college students, 11,417 days of data, up to 5 time points per day
- **Key findings:**
  - Higher than typical doses of single-day and typical cannabis were associated with **longer sleep durations, but only to a point**
  - **At the highest doses, cannabis shortened sleep** (inverted U-shaped relationship)
  - Alcohol showed different patterns
