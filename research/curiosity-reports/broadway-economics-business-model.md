## Financing Structure

### Legal Structure
- Broadway shows are typically organized as **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)**
- Each show is literally a separate business entity
- Investors purchase "units" of membership interest (like shares of stock)
- Source: [Cody Lassen & Associates](https://codylassen.com/broadway-investing-faq/)

### Investment Minimums
- Most Broadway shows offer units at **$50,000**
- Half-units at **$25,000** are common
- Occasionally as low as **$10,000**
- Investors can pool together to reach minimums
- Source: [Cody Lassen & Associates](https://codylassen.com/broadway-investing-faq/)

### Deal Structures
- "**One for One**" / "**One for Two**" / "**One for Three**" deals for co-producers and early investors
- These induce larger commitments with better terms
- Source: [Fox Rothschild](https://payorplay.foxrothschild.com/2017/09/articles/theater/broadway-investing-one-for-one-and-one-for-two-deals/)

### Investor Profile
- Must be **accredited investors** (SEC requirement)
- Many invest "for the love of the arts"
- Perks include: invites to Tony Awards, Broadway League membership, opening night access
- Source: [Squeri Theatrical Productions](https://samanthasqueri.com/investing-faq/)

### Traditional "Angels" Model
From a 1998 legal guide: "A well-dressed group of prospective 'angels' gathers at twilight in a chic Manhattan apartment in the East 60's. The composer sits down at a grand piano and... plays the score of the new musical."

## Success/Failure Rates

### The Classic Statistic
- **1 out of 5 shows (20%)** recoup their investment
- This stat has been cited since at least the 1980s
- "You can make a killing in this business but you can't make a living" - Robert Anderson, 1966
- Source: [Investing Broadway](https://www.investingbroadway.com/broadway-investing-basics)

### Bucknell University Study (2025)
- Most comprehensive public investigation to date of Broadway musical profitability
- Found **less than a quarter returned their full investment**
- Published in *Significance* magazine (statistics and data analysis)
- Authors: Professor Sam Gutekunst and Christopher Kopac '25
- Source: [Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/news/bucknell-study-explores-return-investment-broadway-musicals)

### Post-Pandemic Reality (2025)
- **90% of new musicals** staged after COVID will end runs having lost part or all of investors' money
- **None of the 18 musicals** that opened on Broadway in the 2024-25 season have turned a profit
- Even revivals of classic shows are failing
- Source: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/theater/broadway-musicals-finances.html), [fyi.news](https://fyi.news/en/articles/musicals-no-longer-profitable-on-broadway/)

### 2024-2025 Season Recoupment
- Only **7 shows announced recoupment** in the 2024-2025 season
- **All seven were plays** (not musicals)
- **All but one featured stars**
- Source: [Ken Davenport](https://kendavenport.com/the-7th-show-to-announce-recoupment-and-what-it-tells-us-about-broadway/)

### Producer Track Record Variance
- Some producers have better track records: "maybe 2 or 3 out of 5 recouping"
- Even losing money on 4 shows, a hit on the 5th can put you ahead

## Running Costs and Weekly "Nut"

### The "Nut" Explained
- Weekly operating expenses a show must cover to break even
- Includes: salaries, rent, royalties, marketing, insurance, etc.

### Current Weekly Nut Examples
- "Water for Elephants" (2024): needs **$960,000/week** to cover operating expenses
- Large musicals can have weekly operating costs of **$1 million+**
- Source: [Broadway Journal](https://www.broadwayjournal.com/p/inside-broadways-1-million-nut-cases)

### Theater Rent
- Weekly contractual minimum rent: **$15,000 - $20,000** (base minimum)
- Actual rent is often much higher, calculated as percentage of gross
- During COVID shutdown, producers continued receiving rent bills
- Source: [Broadway News](https://www.broadwaynews.com/broadway-producers-receive-rent-bills-amid-shutdown/)

### Key Metric: NAGBOR
- "Net Adjusted Gross Box Office Receipts"
- Gross minus credit card fees, restoration fees, group sales commissions
- What's actually available for the show to use

## Theater Ownership and Control

### The Big Three
1. **Shubert Organization**: 17 Broadway theaters
2. **Nederlander Organization**: ~9 Broadway theaters
3. **Jujamcyn Theaters** (now partnered with Ambassador Theater Group/ATG): 5 Broadway theaters

Total: 41 Broadway theaters exist, Big Three control ~31 of them

### Shubert Historical Dominance
- By 1924, controlled **75% of all American theatres**
- Produced **25% of all plays**
- This dominance triggered creation of **Actors' Equity** as backlash
- Led to mid-1950s **Supreme Court antitrust ruling** forcing partial divestiture
- Source: [Wikipedia - Shubert Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubert_family)

### Jujamcyn-ATG Merger (2023)
- Jujamcyn combined operations with Ambassador Theater Group (British)
- ATG already operated 2 Broadway houses, has 58 venues globally
- Gives Jordan Roth (Jujamcyn president) more resources
- Source: [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/14/theater/jujamcyn-atg-broadway.html)
