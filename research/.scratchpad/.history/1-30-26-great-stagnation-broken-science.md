## Executive Summary

The United States has been in a state of scientific stagnation since approximately 1970. This is not a fringe claim. It is supported by wage data, productivity statistics, patent analysis, and the testimony of researchers themselves. Peter Thiel, Tyler Cowen, and Robert Gordon have each articulated versions of this thesis from different angles, and the evidence has only strengthened over time.

The uncomfortable truth is that we did this to ourselves. The stagnation is not primarily because "ideas are getting harder to find" (though that may be a factor). It is because we built systems that systematically punish risk-taking, reward safe incrementalism, and exclude young scientists from funding. The NIH, our $48 billion flagship research funder, has become a bureaucratic machine that produces studies rather than solutions. Cancer research is the clearest case study: over $1 trillion spent since 1971, with mortality declining only 27-33% and the deadliest cancers receiving the least funding.

The system isn't broken by accident. It's working exactly as designed. The question is whether we have the will to redesign it.

## Background

In 1945, Vannevar Bush submitted "Science, The Endless Frontier" to President Roosevelt. His vision was elegant: the federal government would fund basic research, scientists would have freedom to explore, and long-term curiosity-driven work would yield practical benefits. This vision shaped American science policy for decades.

Something went wrong.

```
Bush's Vision (1945)          What Actually Happened
┌─────────────────────┐       ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Fund people         │       │ Fund projects       │
│ Long-term freedom   │  ──▶  │ 4-5 year cycles     │
│ Tolerate failure    │       │ Punish failure      │
│ Trust scientists    │       │ Bureaucratic review │
└─────────────────────┘       └─────────────────────┘
```

The transformation happened gradually. Grant applications became longer. Review committees became larger. "Preliminary data" requirements meant you had to prove your research would work before you could get funded to do it. The system selected for caution, conformity, and political skill rather than scientific creativity.

By the time anyone noticed, we had locked ourselves into path-dependent structures that resist reform. The NIH budget grew to $48 billion, but the average age of first-time grant recipients rose from 36 in 1980 to 42+ today. Success rates for R01 grants fell below 20%. The pipeline filled with postdocs stuck in perpetual training, waiting for positions that would never open.

## The Stagnation Thesis

### Thiel's Formulation

Peter Thiel has been the most vocal critic of scientific stagnation. His core claim: meaningful technological progress stopped around 1970, with digital technology as the lone exception.

> "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."
> — Founders Fund Manifesto

This isn't nostalgia. It's an empirical observation. Travel speeds haven't increased in 50 years. Real food and energy prices are higher than 40 years ago. Flying from LA to San Francisco has gotten slower, not faster. The Concorde is retired. Nuclear energy was regulated out of existence.

Thiel's explanation centers on a "regulatory double standard":

> "We basically outlawed everything in the world of atoms; we've left the world of bits relatively unregulated."

Software could iterate freely. Physical innovation faced years of permits, lawsuits, and bureaucratic review. The FDA created "huge barriers" to drug development. Building anything physical became an exercise in navigating regulatory capture.

But Thiel goes further than regulation. He points to cultural shift, institutional decay, and what he calls "universal institutional failure." Science funding became bureaucratized. Peer review became "toxic" because it selected for political skill over scientific insight. By 2025, Thiel stated he "no longer trusts science." This from a man who made billions funding scientific companies.

### Cowen's "Low-Hanging Fruit"

Tyler Cowen's [The Great Stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Stagnation) (2011) offered a complementary thesis. America's growth was driven by three sources of "low-hanging fruit" that are now exhausted:

| Source | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Free Land | Government gave away good land | Gone |
| Cheap Immigrant Labor | Abundant workforce | Constrained |
| Transformative Inventions | Electricity, cars, plumbing, etc. | Picked |

Cowen's point is that everyday life in 2010 was "not sensibly different" from 1985, except for the Internet. Healthcare spending increased without proportional outcomes. Education returns diminished. Median wages flattened.

### Gordon's Special Century

Robert Gordon's [The Rise and Fall of American Growth](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691175805/the-rise-and-fall-of-american-growth) (2016) is the most pessimistic. He argues that 1870-1970 was a "special century" driven by one-time, unrepeatable transformations: electric lighting, indoor plumbing, internal combustion, air travel, air conditioning. These inventions could only happen once. What we're experiencing now isn't stagnation. It's a return to the historical norm of slow growth.

Gordon differs from Thiel in a crucial way. Thiel thinks stagnation is caused by institutional failure and could be reversed. Gordon thinks it's inevitable. The great inventions are behind us.

### The Evidence

The data supports some version of the stagnation thesis:

**Productivity:**
- [Bloom et al. (2020)](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf) found research productivity declining ~5% per year since the 1930s
- Effective US researchers increased 23-fold; TFP growth stayed constant
- Implies a 41-fold decline in research productivity

**Wages:**
- Median compensation diverged from productivity around 1973
- Real wages for most workers have been essentially flat for 50 years

**Papers:**
- [Park, Leahey, Funk (Nature 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x) found papers have become dramatically less "disruptive" since 1945
- The CD index (measuring whether papers make prior work obsolete) declined 91-100% across fields

## Academic Incentive Rot

### Publish or Perish

The phrase "publish or perish" dates to [1928](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2024/07/15/tracing-the-origins-of-publish-or-perish/), but its modern meaning solidified in the postwar era. Tenure decisions came to depend heavily on publication counts and citation metrics. The result was predictable: scientists optimized for publications rather than discoveries.

The h-index (measuring both productivity and citation impact) became currency. Journal impact factors became status markers. Getting into Nature or Science mattered more than whether your findings were true or useful.

This created a system that rewards:
- Incremental extensions of existing work
- Positive results (negative results don't publish well)
- Trendy topics that reviewers already believe in
- Prolific output over careful verification

And punishes:
- Risky, unconventional research
- Replication studies
- Negative or null results
- Long-term projects that don't produce quick publications

### The Replication Crisis

The consequences showed up in the [replication crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18248). When researchers actually tried to reproduce published findings:

| Field | Replication Rate | Source |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| Psychology | 36% | [Open Science Collaboration (2015)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716) |
| Cancer biology (Amgen) | 11% | Begley & Ellis (Nature 2012) |
| Cancer biology (Bayer) | 7% fully reproducible | Bayer HealthCare (2011) |

Let that sink in. Amgen tried to reproduce 53 "landmark" cancer studies. Only 6 held up. That's an 89% failure rate on papers that shaped the field.

[The Lancet estimated](https://dcscience.net/Macleod-2014-Lancet.pdf) that 85% of investment in biomedical research is wasted. That's roughly $200 billion.

This isn't because scientists are frauds. It's because the system incentivizes behavior that produces unreproducible results: small sample sizes, p-hacking, selective reporting, failure to pre-register hypotheses. Individual scientists acting rationally within bad incentives produce collective irrationality.

### Hypercompetition

The pipeline is broken. Universities produce far more PhDs than the academic job market can absorb. [Only 1 in 5 science PhDs](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/02/27/388443923/a-glut-of-ph-d-s-means-long-odds-of-getting-jobs) get faculty positions within five years of graduating. The rest cycle through low-paid postdocs or leave academia entirely.

Postdoc training now averages 6 years, nearly triple what it was 50 years ago. Meanwhile, real postdoc salaries have stagnated or declined. The system uses young scientists as cheap labor while dangling the promise of tenure-track jobs that mostly don't exist.

The result: hypercompetition for a shrinking pool of positions. Scientists play it safe because they can't afford career setbacks. The most creative minds often leave for industry or other fields. Those who stay learn to navigate the politics of grant committees rather than pursue their most ambitious ideas.

## The NIH Problem

### How It Works

The National Institutes of Health distributes roughly $48 billion annually, making it the world's largest public funder of biomedical research. About 82% goes to extramural grants at universities and research institutions.

Grant applications go through Scientific Review Groups (study sections) composed of peer scientists. Reviewers score applications 1-9 on "overall impact." The top-scoring applications get funded. Success rates hover around 19% for R01 grants.

### Why It's Broken

**Risk aversion is baked in.** [Azoulay & Greenblatt (NBER 2025)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w33495) analyzed 100,000+ NIH grants from 1980-2015. They found peer review systematically penalizes risk-taking. Projects with "high degree of risk" face challenges winning support even though they're more likely to produce breakthroughs.

The [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/StephanFranzoniFinal-3.pdf) documented the problem:

> "A number of scientists have expressed concern that the National Institutes of Health is risk averse and becoming increasingly so. The heavy emphasis placed on demonstrating feasibility of the proposed research by providing preliminary findings is responsible for this risk aversion."

The preliminary data requirement is particularly perverse. You need results before you can get funded to produce results. This creates a circular trap that rewards extending existing work over attempting something genuinely new.

**Young scientists are squeezed out.** The average age at first R01 grant has risen from ~36 in 1980 to ~42-43 today. In 1980, 22% of NIH grants went to scientists under 35. By 2001, it was [3.8%](https://www.science.org/content/article/aging-young-scientists). The people with the freshest ideas and most time to pursue them can't get funding.

**Success rates have collapsed.** R01 success rates are around 19%. Early career researchers face even worse odds. SBIR Phase I success rates hit a [record low of 9.9% in 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kirk-macolini-25148b12_nih-sbir-sttr-activity-7328164071042686976-fsG7).

### The HHMI Contrast

The Howard Hughes Medical Institute offers an alternative model. HHMI "funds people, not projects." Investigators get 7-year renewable terms with freedom to pursue whatever they find interesting. Early failure is tolerated. Long-term success is rewarded.

[Azoulay et al. (2011)](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/manso/hhmi.pdf) compared HHMI investigators to similarly accomplished NIH-funded scientists. HHMI investigators produced high-impact research at significantly higher rates. The effect size was "huge."

The catch: HHMI works with a narrow elite. It's not clear the model scales. But it proves that different incentive structures produce different outcomes.

### Why ARPA-H Was Created

The dysfunction became so obvious that Congress created [ARPA-H](https://arpa-h.gov/) in 2022 specifically to bypass NIH bureaucracy. ARPA-H is modeled on DARPA: milestone-based contracts, program manager autonomy, tolerance for failure, focus on transformative goals.

The fact that we needed a new agency to do what NIH should be doing tells you everything about the state of NIH.

## Cancer Research: A Case Study

### The Promise

In 1971, President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act and declared "war on cancer." The goal was straightforward: find a cure. The analogy was the Apollo program. If we could put a man on the moon in a decade, surely we could cure cancer.

### The Spending

Since 1971, we've spent over $1 trillion on cancer research:
- NCI has received [$184 billion from 1938-2025](https://ascopost.com)
- Current NCI budget: ~$7.2 billion/year
- Private pharmaceutical R&D dwarfs this
- American Cancer Society: $3.5 billion since 1991

### The Results

Fifty-four years later, there is no cure.

That's the bad news. The nuanced news is more complicated:
- Cancer mortality has declined 27-33% since 1971
- 5-year survival improved from 49% to 68%
- 3.8 million cancer deaths averted since 1991

But these gains came primarily from:
1. **Smoking cessation** — the largest single factor
2. **Screening and early detection** — colonoscopies, mammograms
3. **HPV vaccination** — 65% reduction in cervical cancer among young women
4. **Targeted therapies** — drugs for specific mutations

The gains did not come from the "cure" that was promised. And they're unevenly distributed. [The deadliest cancers](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/news/2024/02/funding-vs-lethality-the-gross-imbalances-of-cancer-research/) — pancreatic, liver, lung, brain — have seen minimal improvement and receive the least funding relative to their mortality burden.

### Why No Cure?

There are two competing explanations:

**The biology argument:** Cancer isn't one disease. It's over 200 different diseases sharing uncontrolled cell growth. Each broad type has subtypes that differ genetically and molecularly. Tumors are heterogeneous. They evolve resistance. They arise from the patient's own cells, making them hard for the immune system to target.

This is true but incomplete. It explains why cancer is hard. It doesn't explain why we've made so little progress relative to our investment.

**The systems argument:** The cancer research establishment is structured to produce studies, not solutions.

[Clifton Leaf](https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Small-Doses-Cancer-Didnt/dp/1476739994), who spent 9 years investigating, concluded:

> "Our current system is designed not to solve problems, but to produce studies."

Problems he identified:
- No coordination of research efforts
- Only 7% of NCI budget goes to prevention
- Self-perpetuating bureaucracy
- Funding misaligned with outcomes

### The Immunotherapy Scandal

The most damning evidence is what happened to immunotherapy.

James Allison discovered CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade in the 1990s. He demonstrated it worked in mice in 1994. Drug companies weren't interested. The cancer establishment called him "foolish" for arguing the immune system could fight cancer.

It took until 2011 for the first checkpoint inhibitor (ipilimumab) to reach FDA approval. Allison won the Nobel Prize in 2018.

The approach that would transform cancer treatment was ignored for decades because it challenged conventional wisdom. The peer review system, designed to maintain quality, instead maintained orthodoxy.

Katalin Karikó's story with mRNA is similar. Demoted four times, threatened with deportation, grant after grant rejected. The technology that would produce COVID vaccines in record time was nearly killed by the funding system.

### Comparison: HIV/AIDS

HIV/AIDS moved faster. From first cases in 1981 to HAART combination therapy in 1996 — 15 years. From death sentence to manageable chronic condition. Now we have multiple functional cures.

Why the difference?

1. **Activism** — ACT UP forced regulatory reform through direct action
2. **Clear target** — one virus, not 200+ diseases
3. **Regulatory change** — accelerated approval pathways created in response
4. **Unified focus** — less heterogeneity in the problem

Cancer lacks all of these advantages. But it also lacked the urgency that activism created. The cancer research establishment was too comfortable with incremental progress.

## Are Ideas Actually Harder to Find?

### The Bloom et al. Thesis

[Bloom, Jones, Van Reenen, and Webb](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf) argue that ideas are genuinely getting harder to find. Their most striking example: maintaining Moore's Law now requires 18x more researchers than in the early 1970s. The doubling rate stayed constant; research effort exploded.

They find similar patterns across domains:

| Domain | Research Productivity Decline |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Aggregate economy | ~5.3%/year |
| Semiconductors | ~6.8%/year |
| Agriculture | ~5.5%/year |
| Firm-level | ~10%/year |

[Eroom's Law](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681) (Moore spelled backwards) captures the pharmaceutical version: drugs approved per billion R&D dollars has halved every 9 years since 1950. That's an 80-fold decline.

### The Counterarguments

The Bloom thesis has attracted significant criticism:

**Institutional decay, not idea exhaustion:** [Guzey et al.](https://guzey.com/economics/bloom/) argue that TFP (total factor productivity) is a terrible measure of innovation. TFP captures implemented innovation, not discovered innovation. Many innovations exist but aren't adopted due to institutional barriers, regulatory capture, and market failures.

**Ideas aren't harder to find — just harder to sell:** [Tadepalli (Asterisk 2025)](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/12-books/ideas-arent-getting-harder-to-find) argues the problem is commercialization, not discovery. Market failures prevent innovative firms from capturing returns. Incumbents are protected; startups disadvantaged.

**Researcher quality dilution:** [Ekerdt & Wu (2024)](https://papers.ssrn.com) found that roughly half of the productivity decline can be explained by expanding the researcher pool. As researcher share of the labor force increases, average researcher quality declines. If Nobel-caliber researchers are always ~0.01% of population, hiring more researchers doesn't produce more breakthroughs.

### The Burden of Knowledge

[Benjamin Jones](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/jones-ben/htm/research.htm) offers a complementary hypothesis: the "burden of knowledge." As knowledge accumulates, each generation of scientists must learn more before contributing. This manifests as:

- Rising age at first invention (+6 years over 20th century)
- Increasing team sizes on patents
- Greater specialization (narrower expertise)
- Longer training periods

The implications are sobering. Even if idea difficulty isn't increasing, the cost of reaching the frontier is. Scientists spend more of their careers learning and less producing.

### My Assessment

The truth is probably a combination:

1. **Some ideas are genuinely harder** — the easiest discoveries in any field get made first
2. **Institutions have decayed** — NIH, universities, and peer review select against risk
3. **The burden of knowledge is real** — frontiers are farther from the starting line
4. **Measurement problems exist** — TFP misses many forms of progress

But the relative weights matter. If stagnation is primarily inherent (low-hanging fruit picked), we should accept slower growth. If it's primarily institutional, we can fix it.

The evidence from HHMI, the mRNA and immunotherapy stories, and the contrast between bits and atoms suggests institutions matter a lot. Software continued innovating because it escaped regulatory capture. Biomedical research stagnated because it didn't.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Scientific stagnation since ~1970 is real, not imagined.** Multiple independent lines of evidence — wages, productivity, paper "disruptiveness," patent analysis — converge on the same conclusion. Something changed around 1970 and hasn't recovered.

2. **The stagnation is largely self-inflicted.** Regulation, bureaucratization of science funding, publish-or-perish incentives, and risk-averse peer review created a system that systematically punishes breakthrough research. We didn't run out of ideas. We built institutions that can't recognize or fund them.

3. **The NIH is the problem, not the solution.** $48 billion annually, 19% success rates, average age 42+ for first grants, systematic bias against risk-taking. ARPA-H was created because NIH can't reform itself.

4. **Cancer research proves the dysfunction.** $1 trillion+ spent, no cure, deadliest cancers least funded, immunotherapy ignored for decades. The system produces studies, not solutions.

5. **Young scientists are being destroyed.** Rising grant ages, perpetual postdocs, 3.8% of grants to under-35s. The people with the most time, energy, and fresh perspectives can't participate.

6. **The replication crisis is a feature, not a bug.** When you reward publication counts over truth, you get unreproducible papers. 85% of biomedical research investment may be wasted.

7. **Alternative models work.** HHMI, DARPA, and private foundations produce more breakthrough research per dollar. The problem isn't money. It's structure.

---

## Predictions

1. **Without structural reform, biomedical stagnation will continue through 2035.** NIH is too bureaucratically captured to reform itself. ARPA-H is too small to matter at scale. The incentive problems are getting worse, not better.

2. **AI will partially compensate for declining research productivity by 2030.** AI tools for literature review, hypothesis generation, and experimental design will make individual researchers more productive. This will mask but not fix the underlying institutional problems.

3. **The next Nobel-worthy discovery in biomedicine is already being rejected by NIH grant committees.** Based on historical patterns (Karikó, Allison, Marshall), transformative research is systematically rejected by peer review. Someone working on something important right now is being told it won't work.

4. **China will surpass the US in biomedical research output by 2030.** Not because of superior science, but because American institutions are too calcified to adapt. China is building new research infrastructure without legacy bureaucracy.

5. **Private foundations and patient advocacy groups will become increasingly important funders of breakthrough research.** They're not constrained by NIH's risk aversion. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation model — patient groups directly funding research — will spread.

6. **The current NIH funding cuts (2025) will, counterintuitively, accelerate some good research.** Researchers forced out of the NIH system may find more productive homes in industry, startups, or foreign institutions. Brain drain is bad for NIH; it may be neutral or positive for science.

7. **Within 10 years, a major scandal will expose systematic fraud or waste in a flagship NIH research program.** The replication crisis numbers suggest there's a lot of unreliable research being funded. Eventually, the wrong paper will be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
