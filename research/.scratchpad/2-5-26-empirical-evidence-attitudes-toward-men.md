### Methodology

- **5 separate studies + random-effects meta-analysis**, N = 9,799 total participants
- **9 countries:** US, UK, Italy, Poland, Japan, India, South Korea, China (mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan)
- **2 nationally representative samples** (Poland and UK); 18 convenience samples (university students, Prolific panels)
- Proportion identifying as feminist: 40.1% overall; range from 8.1% (Polish nationally representative) to 72% (British psychology undergrads)

### How feminism was measured

Three operationalizations used across studies:
- Discrete and continuous measures of **feminist identification** ("Are you a feminist?"; "How feminist do you consider yourself to be?")
- **Feminist ideology** including core/liberal feminist beliefs (e.g., "Girls and women have not been treated as well as boys and men in our society")
- **Feminist collective action** (participation in #MeToo, willingness to take part in demonstrations)

### How attitudes toward men were measured

- **Feeling thermometers:** Scale from "extremely cool/unfavourable" to "extremely warm/favourable" with marked neutral midpoint (primary measure in most studies)
- Scales of **liking and trust** of men
- **Emotional reactions** to men
- **Benevolence toward men and hostility toward men** subscales (from Glick & Fiske's AMI, 1999)
- **Single-Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT):** Reaction-time measure of automatic associations between "men" and positive/negative categories (Study 3 only)
- Also measured: **realistic and symbolic threat** (e.g., "Many women live in fear of men's aggression"), **gender similarity** (Inclusion of Other in Self scale variant)

### Key Findings (from meta-analyses)

| Finding | Effect Size (Cohen's d) |
|---|---|
| Feminists' attitudes toward men are significantly MORE positive than neutral | d = 0.73 |
| Difference between feminists' and nonfeminists' overall attitudes toward men | d = -0.07 (NOT significant) |
| Feminists' implicit attitudes toward men (SC-IAT) | d = 0.71 (positive) |
| Nonfeminists' implicit attitudes toward men (SC-IAT) | d = 0.59 (positive) |
| Implicit attitude difference between feminists and nonfeminists | NOT significant |
| Participants underestimated positivity of feminists' attitudes toward men | d = -0.95 |
| Even feminist participants underestimated fellow feminists' positivity | d range: -0.38 to -1.44 |
| Participants believed feminists' attitudes were below neutral (absolute version of stereotype) | d = -0.22 |

### Mechanism findings (Studies 4 and 5)

Two opposing forces shape feminists' attitudes toward men:

1. **Threat perception:** Feminists perceived men as more of a threat to women's dignity and welfare than nonfeminists did. This was associated with LESS positive attitudes toward men.
2. **Gender similarity perception:** Feminists perceived men and women as MORE similar than nonfeminists did. This was associated with MORE positive attitudes toward men.

These opposing forces largely cancel out, explaining the null overall difference.

The public's error: Participants were ACCURATE in perceiving that feminists see men as more of a threat. But they were INACCURATE in perceiving that feminists see men and women as dissimilar -- feminists actually see them as MORE similar. This misperception of gender similarity beliefs is identified as a key driver of the "misandry myth."

Two mechanisms underlie the stereotype:
- **Motivated reasoning:** The misandry belief was associated with hostile sexism (ideological opposition to feminism)
- **Heuristic error:** Participants misperceived feminists' beliefs about gender similarity

### What about radical/cultural feminism?

- In the one study that included non-mainstream ideologies, **radical and cultural feminism were associated with less positive attitudes toward men**
- BUT the effects were small: "a participant would have to be located 3 or 4 standard deviations above the mean for their predicted attitudes to men to fall to neutral values"
- Authors flag this should be replicated

### Feminist collective action and MeToo

- Feminist collective action (including MeToo participation/support) was **unrelated** to attitudes toward men
- It WAS positively associated with **collective anger** about women's experiences of sexual misconduct
- Authors: "Feminism is associated with anger about men's mistreatment of women, but not with negative overall evaluations of men"

### Additional finding: Women-are-wonderful among feminists

- Both feminists and nonfeminists had more favorable attitudes toward women than toward men (replicating the well-established "women are wonderful" effect)
- This effect was MORE pronounced among feminists, but because they were more positive about women, NOT more negative about men (d = 0.25 stronger pro-women preference)
- Feminists who had more positive attitudes toward women also tended to have more positive attitudes toward men (r = .46)
- Participants imagined this correlation was essentially zero (r = -.00)
- Chalmers (2024 PhD, unpublished) extended this to policy preferences: feminists' support for initiatives helping men/boys was POSITIVELY correlated with support for initiatives helping women/girls (not zero-sum)

### Limitations (acknowledged by authors)

1. **Self-report measures** (except Study 3 SC-IAT) -- subject to social desirability bias
2. Studies are a **snapshot of a particular historical moment** -- attitudes could change
3. Does not capture all possible dimensions (attributional style, communicative style, etc.)
4. Convenience samples for most studies (though 2 nationally representative)
5. The AMI (used in some analyses) measures ideological beliefs about gender roles, not pure warmth/liking
6. Cross-sectional design -- cannot establish causality for mechanism findings

### Potential critiques NOT raised by authors

1. **Demand characteristics:** Self-identifying as "feminist" in a psychology study may prime socially desirable responses on subsequent attitude measures
2. **Selection bias in the "feminist" category:** The 40% who identify as feminist in these samples may represent the moderate mainstream; the stereotype may be driven by a visible but smaller subgroup not captured by typical survey research
3. **Feeling thermometers** may not capture behavioral hostility, hostile online discourse, or systemic critique that could be perceived as hostility
4. The study measures **attitudes** (warmth/coolness feelings) but not **beliefs about what should happen to men** (policy preferences, zero-sum resource allocation)
5. **Publication in Psychology of Women Quarterly** -- a journal housed within feminist scholarship. Peer-reviewed, but some may question whether editorial context affects framing
6. The large international author team strengthens generalizability but could create methodology consistency challenges across sites

### Methodology

- **N = 488** undergraduate students
- **Location:** Large, nonresidential, Hispanic-serving public university in Texas
- **Demographics:** 66% women; 41% Latina/o (n=200), 27% African American (n=133), 16% White (n=80), 7% Asian American (n=32)
- **Attitude measure:** Ambivalence toward Men Inventory (AMI; Glick & Fiske, 1999)
  - Hostility toward Men (HM): 10 items, 0-5 scale, alpha = .82
  - Benevolence toward Men (BM): 10 items, 0-5 scale, alpha = .79
- **Feminist identification:** Two-step process:
  1. Respondents asked to define feminism
  2. Only those whose definitions were consistent with operational definition (reference to equal rights, acknowledgment of inequality, need for social change) were included
  3. Inter-rater agreement: 94%
  4. Of those with correct definitions: asked "are you a feminist?" (yes/no/unsure)

### Feminist identification rates

| Category | Percent | n |
|---|---|---|
| Defined feminism correctly | 60.7% | 296 |
| Of correct definers: Feminist | 14.13% | 41 |
| Of correct definers: Nonfeminist | 57.59% | 167 |
| Of correct definers: Unsure | 28.28% | 82 |

Women significantly more likely to identify as feminist than men: chi2(2, n=290) = 9.99, p = .01.

By ethnicity: Whites 22.64% feminist, Latina/os 16.52%, Asian Americans 17.65%, African Americans 4.88%. No significant ethnic differences.

### Primary finding: MANOVA results

Analysis reduced to n=207 (collapsed ethnicity to White/POC, excluded "unsure").

**Multivariate main effect for Feminist Identification:**
Wilks's Lambda = .96, F(1, 198) = 4.43, p = .01, eta-squared = .04

**Univariate tests:**

| DV | F | df | p | eta-squared |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Benevolence toward Men | 8.26 | 1, 199 | .01 | .04 |
| Hostility toward Men | 4.81 | 1, 199 | .03 | .02 |

**Direction: Feminists had LOWER levels of both HM and BM than nonfeminists.**

No significant Feminist ID x Gender interaction: Wilks's Lambda = .99, F(2, 198) = .29, p = .75
No significant Feminist ID x Ethnicity interaction: Wilks's Lambda = .98, F(2, 198) = 2.20, p = .11

### Mean scores (0-5 scale)

| Group | Hostility toward Men | Benevolence toward Men |
|---|---|---|
| POC Feminist Women | 2.60 | 2.11 |
| POC Nonfeminist Women | 2.70 | 2.37 |
| White Feminist Women | 1.95 | 1.07 |
| White Nonfeminist Women | 2.55 | 1.83 |
| POC Feminist Men | 2.27 | 2.12 |
| POC Nonfeminist Men | 2.21 | 2.70 |
| White Feminist Men | 0.85 | 1.40 |
| White Nonfeminist Men | 2.04 | 2.55 |

### Gender and ethnicity effects (full sample, N = 488)

Gender main effects:
- HM: F(1, 460) = 22.04, p < .001, eta-squared = .05 (women > men)
- BM: F(1, 460) = 16.08, p < .001, eta-squared = .03 (men > women)

Ethnicity main effects:
- HM: F(4, 460) = 4.87, p < .001, eta-squared = .04
- BM: F(4, 460) = 7.64, p < .001, eta-squared = .06
- Tukey post-hoc: White respondents lower on both HM and BM than Latina/os, African Americans, and Asian Americans

### Limitations

1. **Small feminist sample:** Only 41 self-identified feminists in the key analysis
2. **College student sample** from a single university
3. **Cross-sectional design**
4. **Definition requirement** excluded respondents who couldn't define feminism correctly -- filtering out ~40% of the sample
5. **Effect sizes are small** (eta-squared = .02 to .04) -- feminist identification explains only 2-4% of variance in attitudes
6. The AMI measures ideological beliefs about gender roles, not simple warmth/liking
7. The "unsure" category (28%) was excluded entirely
8. HM and BM were positively correlated r(487) = .46 -- people who endorse hostile views also tend to endorse benevolent views

## 3. The Ambivalence toward Men Inventory (AMI) -- Glick & Fiske (1999)

**Full citation:** Glick, P., & Fiske, S. T. (1999). The Ambivalence toward Men Inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent beliefs about men. *Psychology of Women Quarterly*, 23(3), 519-536.

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1999.tb00379.x

### What it measures

The AMI is a 20-item self-report scale measuring ambivalent attitudes toward men. It is the complement to the widely-used Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) which measures attitudes toward women. Both are grounded in ambivalent sexism theory.

**Two 10-item subscales:**

### Hostility toward Men (HM)

Three subfactors:

**1. Resentment of Paternalism** -- hostility toward men's perceived power and patronizing behavior
- "When men act to 'help' women, they are often trying to prove they are better than women"
- "Men will always fight to have greater control in society than women"

**2. Compensatory Gender Differentiation** -- viewing men as deficient in domestic/emotional qualities
- "Men act like babies when they are sick"
- "When it comes to the home, men are like children who need to be taken care of"

**3. Heterosexual Hostility** -- resentment of men's perceived sexual aggression and control in intimate relationships
- "Most men pay lip service to equality for women, but can't handle having a woman as an equal"
- "A man who is sexually attracted to a woman typically has no morals about doing whatever it takes to get her in bed"
- "Men would be lost in this world if women weren't there to guide them"

### Benevolence toward Men (BM)

Three subfactors:

**1. Maternalism** -- belief that women should care for men domestically
- "Even if both members of a couple work, the woman ought to be more attentive to taking care of her man at home"

**2. Complementary Gender Differentiation** -- admiring men for stereotypically masculine qualities
- "Men are more willing to take risks than women"
- "Men are more willing to put themselves in danger to protect others"

**3. Heterosexual Intimacy** -- viewing romantic relationships with men as essential for women's completeness
- "Women are incomplete without men"
- "Every woman needs a male partner who will cherish her"
- "Every woman ought to have a man she adores"

### Psychometric properties

- **Reliability:** Cronbach's alpha .81-.86 for HM; .79-.83 for BM across validation studies
- **HM-BM correlation:** Positive (r ~ .46 in Anderson et al., 2009), meaning hostility and benevolence toward men tend to co-occur -- consistent with ambivalent sexism theory
- **Short version:** Rollero, Glick, & Tartaglia (2014) validated a 12-item version with 960 Italian adults; good CFA fit
- **Cross-cultural validation:** Glick et al. (2004) used it across 16 nations. Factor structure holds. National-level findings: Both HM and BM higher in nations with less gender equality (measured by UN Gender Empowerment Measure and Gender Development Index)

### Critical interpretive issue: What does HM actually capture?

HM does NOT measure pure negative affect or dislike toward men as individuals. It specifically measures:
- Resentment of **systemic male power** and patronizing behavior
- Beliefs that men are **deficient in stereotypically feminine domains** (domestic skills, emotional sensitivity)
- Resentment of men's **sexual aggression and relationship control**

This is crucial for interpreting results from Anderson et al. (2009) and Hopkins-Doyle et al. (2024). When feminists score LOW on HM, it means they are less likely to endorse statements like "Men act like babies when they are sick" -- which is itself a gender stereotype, not an expression of pure hostility. Feminists may reject such stereotypes while harboring other negative sentiments not captured by the AMI.

The AMI was designed within ambivalent sexism theory to capture attitudes that MAINTAIN gender hierarchy. High HM + high BM together = traditional gender ideology that subordinates both sexes to complementary roles. The theory predicts (and finds) that these attitudes are highest in gender-unequal societies.

## 4. Other Empirical Studies Measuring Attitudes Toward Men

### 4a. Rudman & Goodwin (2004) -- Automatic In-Group Bias

**Full citation:** Rudman, L. A., & Goodwin, S. A. (2004). Gender differences in automatic in-group bias: Why do women like women more than men like men? *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 87(4), 494-509.

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.87.4.494

**Full text:** https://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf

**Journal:** JPSP -- the top journal in personality and social psychology. 350+ Scopus citations.

**4 experiments using IAT and other implicit measures.**

Key findings:
- Women show **strong automatic in-group bias** (preference for women over men)
- Men show **no automatic in-group bias** -- they do NOT prefer men over women
- In fact, men show a slight pro-female implicit preference
- Only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, gender identity, and self-esteem
- Men LACK the psychological mechanism that bolsters automatic own-group preference
- **Male gender identity is the only social identity tested that does not produce in-group favoritism** on implicit measures
- The pro-female bias is linked to automatically favoring mothers over fathers and associating male gender with violence/destruction
- For sexually experienced men, more positive attitudes toward sex predicted more implicit favoritism toward women

**Why this matters:** This is not about feminism at all -- it is about the general population. At the level of automatic cognitive associations, men as a social category receive less favorable evaluation than women, from BOTH sexes. This is one of the most robust findings in the implicit attitudes literature on gender.

**Citations:**

- Eagly, A. H., & Mladinic, A. (1994). Are people prejudiced against women? Some answers from research on attitudes, gender stereotypes, and judgments of competence. *European Review of Social Psychology*, 5(1), 1-35.

Key findings:
- Both men and women associate more positive attributes with women than with men
- The effect is driven by women's perceived **communion** (warmth, nurturance, morality)
- Men are evaluated more favorably on **agency** (competence, assertiveness) but less favorably in overall evaluation
- The effect has been replicated extensively

**Cross-cultural:** Krys, K., et al. (2018, JPSP) found the "women-are-wonderful" effect across 44 nations, but it is **smaller in more gender-egalitarian societies** -- suggesting it is partially tied to traditional gender role expectations, not a fixed universal.

### 4c. Glick et al. (2004) -- 16-Nation Study of Attitudes Toward Men

**Full citation:** Glick, P., Lameiras, M., Fiske, S. T., Eckes, T., Masser, B., Volpato, C., et al. (2004). Bad but bold: Ambivalent attitudes toward men predict gender inequality in 16 nations. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 86, 713-728.

Key findings:
- In most nations, HM was higher among women than men
- BM was higher among men than women
- Both HM and BM were **higher in nations with less gender equality** (as measured by UN indices)
- The more hostile men were toward women (hostile sexism), the more women resented men and felt hostility toward them
- Women's hostility toward men in traditional nations does NOT challenge gender hierarchy -- it coexists with benevolent beliefs about men as protectors/providers
- Resentment toward men is linked more to **antifeminism and gender inequality** than to feminism and gender equality

- Earliest dedicated measure of attitudes toward men
- Measured agreement with statements about marriage, parenthood, sexuality, work, physical/personality attributes
- Compared 28 feminists (NOW members) to 104 nonmembers
- Result: NOW members' attitudes toward men were **not significantly different** from nonmembers
- Primarily of historical interest due to very small sample

- Tracked 62 American students through a semester-long women's studies course
- Feminist identity and beliefs strengthened after course completion
- **No detectable change in prejudice toward men**
- Limitation: Small sample, no control for other factors

**Citation:** Maltby, J., & Day, L. (2001). Psychological correlates of attitudes toward men. *The Journal of Psychology*, 135, 335-351.

- The more **feminine** (not masculine, not androgynous) women regarded themselves, the more likely they held **negative attitudes toward men**
- Given that nonfeminists tend to endorse more traditional gender roles (Saunders & Kashubeck-West, 2006), this implies nonfeminists may hold more negative attitudes toward men
- Implication: Traditional femininity, NOT feminism, correlates with negative attitudes toward men

- Among 234 American college students, those who identified as feminists recorded **less positive** attitudes to men than nonfeminist classmates
- This is one of the few studies finding SUPPORT for the stereotype
- Note: Cited by Hopkins-Doyle et al. (2024) as part of the "mixed findings" in the pre-existing literature
- Small convenience sample, single measure

**Full text:** https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1534129/1/Gender%20Empathy%20Gap%20Seager%20Farrell%20Barry%202016.pdf

**Journal:** New Male Studies (Australian Institute of Male Health and Studies). NOT a mainstream psychology journal. No impact factor available. The journal is affiliated with men's issues advocacy organizations.

**Nature of paper:** This is a **position paper/commentary**, NOT an empirical study with original data. It synthesizes existing evidence and makes an argument for action.

**Author note:** Warren Farrell is listed as co-author. Farrell is primarily known as a men's rights advocate and author (The Myth of Male Power, The Boy Crisis), not as a peer-reviewed academic researcher. John Barry has published more academic work on male psychology.

**Key claims made:**
- Men have evolved to be "disposable" -- positioned as protectors, not protected
- Male distress is often invisible because it manifests differently (aggression, substance use, risk-taking rather than crying/help-seeking)
- Field experiments show people rush to help female victims but ignore/ridicule male victims (cites ManKind Initiative 2014 -- a YouTube video demonstration, NOT peer-reviewed)
- Male identity is the only group identity that doesn't elicit in-group favoritism (cites Rudman & Goodwin, 2004 -- peer-reviewed)
- Men are 6x more likely to get convicted for identical crimes (cites Bradford, 2015 -- non-peer-reviewed analysis)
- 97% of workplace deaths in UK are men
- Male suicide rate nearly 4x female rate in UK (ONS data)

**Quality assessment:** LOW. References mix peer-reviewed work with advocacy websites, YouTube videos, and books in preparation. Published in a venue created for men's issues advocacy. However, several of the underlying claims it makes ARE supported by peer-reviewed research cited below.

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.05.002

**Full text:** https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Reynolds-et-al.-2020-1.pdf and https://iswmatters.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reynoldsetal2020-GenderBiasMoralTypecasting.pdf

**Journal:** OBHDP -- top-tier organizational behavior journal.

**Theoretical framework:** Moral typecasting theory (Gray & Wegner, 2009) predicts that people automatically sort social targets into "moral agents" (those who DO, including perpetrators) and "moral patients" (those who are DONE TO, including victims). This sorting is seen as a cognitive dimension -- being cast as more of an agent makes one less of a patient, and vice versa.

**6 studies:**

| Study | N | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 203 | Participants assumed harmed targets were female (vs. male), especially when labeled "victim" |
| 2 | 166 | Animated shapes perpetrating harm perceived as male; victimized shapes perceived as female |
| 3 | 203 | Female employee claiming harassment seen as more of a victim than identical male claimant |
| 4 | 401 | Female victims expected to experience more pain from ambiguous joke; male perpetrators prescribed harsher punishments |
| 5 | 399 | Managers perceived as less moral when firing female (vs. male) employees |
| 6 | 396 | Possibility of gender discrimination intensified the cognitive link between women and victimhood |

**Significance:** This is a methodologically strong, multi-study paper in a top journal showing that gender bias in victim/perpetrator perception is robust across varied contexts. The bias operates at a cognitive level -- people automatically associate "victim" with female and "perpetrator" with male even in novel or ambiguous situations.

**Full text:** https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-023-02571-0.pdf

**Journal:** Archives of Sexual Behavior -- respected journal in sex/gender research.

**3 experimental studies (2 pre-registered).**

**Study 1 (N = 160, pre-registered, CloudResearch/MTurk):**
- Workplace intervention scenario reducing harassment/incivility by 36%, but some employees (male or female, randomly assigned) experienced negative psychological outcomes
- IH acceptance when harm befalls men: M = 4.51, SD = 1.43
- IH acceptance when harm befalls women: M = 3.94, SD = 1.44
- **t(155) = 2.44, p = .016, 95% CI [0.11, 1.01], d = 0.39**
- Participants judged harm severity equally regardless of target gender: t(155) = 0.18, p = .861
- **Interaction with participant gender:** F(1, 151) = 8.88, p = .003, partial eta-squared = .06
  - Female participants showed STRONGER asymmetry (more willing to accept harm to men vs. women)
  - Main effect of condition: F(1, 151) = 12.60, p < .001, partial eta-squared = .07

**Study 2:** Broader array of contexts and interventions. Replicated the pattern.

**Study 3 (pre-registered):** Tested boundary condition in traditionally female caregiving contexts (caring for infants, children, elderly, ill). Even in these domains, participants STILL more readily accepted instrumental harm to men than women. Hypothesis 3 (that the bias would be neutralized in female caregiving domains) was NOT supported.

**Institution:** Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) / University of Chicago Human Capital and Economic Opportunity (HCEO)

**Updated version (2023): Over 30,000 American participants across multiple experiments.**

Key findings:
- People are **more accepting of males falling behind** than females falling behind
- People are **less supportive of government policies** supporting males who fall behind
- **Female participants** showed this bias more strongly than male participants
- The mechanism: **statistical fairness discrimination** -- people believe males are more likely than females to fall behind due to **lack of effort** rather than circumstances beyond their control
- This is NOT driven by believing men already have advantages that make support unnecessary -- the bias persists even when the male disadvantage is clearly and unambiguously established
- The authors describe this as "a gender bias against low-performing males, particularly among female participants"

## 6. Critiques and Methodological Concerns

### A. Critiques of the "feminists don't hate men" studies

**Measurement validity:**
- The AMI (used in Anderson et al., 2009; partially in Hopkins-Doyle) measures IDEOLOGICAL beliefs about gender roles, not pure affective warmth or liking. A feminist scoring low on "Men act like babies when they are sick" is rejecting a gender stereotype, not necessarily expressing warmth toward men. The construct is what you are measuring matters enormously.
- Feeling thermometers (Hopkins-Doyle primary measure) are better for capturing affective attitudes but remain self-report.

**Social desirability bias:**
- Self-report measures of prejudice are notoriously vulnerable to impression management.
- Hopkins-Doyle et al. partially addressed this with the SC-IAT in Study 3, finding consistent results (positive implicit attitudes, no feminist/nonfeminist difference).
- Counter-point: The SC-IAT for gender is itself debated. The pervasive "women are wonderful" effect may inflate positive associations with both gender categories. The SC-IAT may be measuring something different from interpersonal attitudes.

**Selection effects:**
- The 40% who self-identify as feminist in these samples likely represent the moderate, mainstream position. The misandry stereotype may be driven by a visible but numerically small subgroup not well-represented in typical survey research.
- Hopkins-Doyle et al. explicitly acknowledge: "There is little doubt that some feminists do hold negative attitudes toward men, and some attest that it is a necessary and legitimate response to the inequality and misogyny women experience."
- The variance within the feminist population is important but somewhat underexplored -- focus is on central tendency.

**Demand characteristics:**
- Participants who have just self-identified as "feminist" in a study may be motivated to subsequently demonstrate that they are not hostile toward men. This is a classic priming concern.
- The implicit measure (Study 3) addresses this to some extent, but was used in only one of five studies.

**Attitudes vs. behavior gap:**
- Holding positive affective attitudes toward men as a group does not preclude: supporting policies perceived as disadvantaging men, engaging in hostile online discourse, making negative generalizations about men in conversation, or other behavioral expressions that could fuel the stereotype.
- Chalmers (2024 PhD, unpublished) found feminists are NOT zero-sum in policy preferences, but this work has not yet been peer-reviewed.

**Publication context:**
- Both Anderson et al. (2009) and Hopkins-Doyle et al. (2024) are published in Psychology of Women Quarterly, a journal of APA Division 35 (Psychology of Women). While rigorously peer-reviewed, the journal exists within feminist scholarship, and some critics may question whether this context affects editorial framing or reviewer selection.

### B. Critiques of the empathy gap literature

**Publication venue for the founding paper:**
- Seager, Farrell & Barry (2016) is published in New Male Studies, not a mainstream peer-reviewed psychology journal. The journal is affiliated with men's rights advocacy. Warren Farrell is primarily an advocate. The paper is a commentary, not original empirical research. It should not be cited as peer-reviewed evidence of an empathy gap -- it is a position paper that cites a mix of peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources.

**Conflation of distinct phenomena:**
- Sentencing disparities, bystander intervention differences, suicide rates, workplace death rates, trolley problem responses, and differential victim perception each have **multiple explanatory mechanisms**. Bundling all of them under a single "empathy gap" oversimplifies.
- Example: Sentencing disparities may reflect **paternalistic protection of women** (benevolent sexism) rather than callousness toward men. The mechanism matters for intervention design.
- Example: Higher male suicide completion reflects method lethality (men use more lethal means) as well as help-seeking barriers, not purely reduced empathy for male suffering.

**However, the strongest empirical evidence IS peer-reviewed and methodologically strong:**
- Rudman & Goodwin (2004) -- JPSP (top journal): Male identity uniquely lacks in-group favoritism. 4 experiments.
- Reynolds et al. (2020) -- OBHDP (top journal): Gender bias in moral typecasting. 6 studies.
- Graso et al. (2023) -- Archives of Sexual Behavior: Greater acceptance of instrumental harm to men. 3 studies, 2 pre-registered.
- Cappelen et al. (2023) -- NHH/Chicago working paper: Gender bias against males falling behind. 30,000+ participants.
- FeldmanHall et al. (2016): Trolley problem gender bias. Replicated in VR.
- These cannot be dismissed on methodological grounds.

**The "women are wonderful" effect complicates interpretation:**
- The pro-female bias and anti-male relative deficit may be two sides of one coin rather than independent phenomena.
- The differential may reflect **benevolent sexism toward women** (women need protection, women are warm/moral) rather than hostility toward men per se.
- Krys et al. (2018) found the "women are wonderful" effect is **smaller in more gender-egalitarian societies**, suggesting it is partially tied to traditional gender role expectations rather than being a fixed human universal.

**Evolutionary explanations are speculative:**
- The "male disposability" hypothesis (men evolved to be expendable protectors) is a theoretical framework, not an empirically demonstrated causal mechanism.
- Cultural/socialization explanations (men are socialized not to show vulnerability; gender roles teach that men are tough) are equally plausible and not mutually exclusive.
- The evolutionary framing carries ideological weight in men's rights discourse and should be evaluated critically rather than accepted as established science.

### C. Cross-cutting methodological issues

1. **WEIRD samples dominate:** Nearly all studies use Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic populations. Even Hopkins-Doyle et al.'s "cross-cultural" samples are primarily university students in urban Asia, not representative of those populations. Glick et al. (2004) is the most truly cross-cultural, using nationally varied samples.

2. **Self-report limitations persist:** Even implicit measures (IAT, SC-IAT) have debated validity specifically for gender attitudes, where the "women are wonderful" effect may confound results.

3. **The conceptual gap between attitudes and behavior:** Holding positive affective attitudes toward men as a group is compatible with supporting policies that disadvantage men, tolerating gendered double standards, or showing differential empathy in specific behavioral contexts. The "feminists don't hate men" research and the "empathy gap" research may both be correct -- measuring different things.

4. **Operationalization determines findings:** How you define and measure "hostility toward men" shapes your results:
   - AMI Hostility subscale: Feminists score LOWER (less hostile)
   - Feeling thermometers: No feminist/nonfeminist difference
   - Implicit measures: No difference
   - Behavioral measures of harm acceptance: Significant bias AGAINST men (Reynolds, Graso, Cappelen)
   - These are not contradictory -- they measure genuinely different constructs

5. **The two literatures talk past each other:** The "feminists' attitudes" research asks whether identifying as feminist predicts negative AFFECTIVE evaluation of men. The "empathy gap" research asks whether people show differential BEHAVIORAL responses to male vs. female suffering/harm. These are distinct questions, and both sets of findings appear robust within their own domains.
