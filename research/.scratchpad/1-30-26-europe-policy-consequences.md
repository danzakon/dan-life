# The Policies and Their Consequences: Europe's Self-Inflicted Decline

---

## The Experiment

For roughly two decades, Western European governments ran an experiment. The hypothesis: You can combine large-scale immigration from the developing world with generous welfare states and loose integration requirements, and everything will work out through some combination of economic growth and cultural adaptation.

The results are in. The experiment failed.

This is not a story about racism or xenophobia. It's a story about policy choices and their predictable consequences - consequences that critics warned about for years while being dismissed as alarmists or bigots.

## What They Did

### Open Borders Without Integration Infrastructure

The policy was straightforward: accept large numbers of migrants, provide housing and benefits, and assume integration would happen organically.

**Sweden's approach:**
- Accepted more asylum seekers per capita than any EU country in 2015 (1.6% of population in one year)
- Placed refugees in segregated housing blocks in suburban areas
- Provided welfare benefits but few pathways to employment
- Made no serious demands for language acquisition or cultural adaptation
- Treated any criticism of these policies as evidence of racism

**France's approach:**
- Built massive public housing projects (HLMs) on urban peripheries in the 1960s-70s
- Concentrated immigrant populations in these banlieues
- Provided welfare but tolerated 30%+ unemployment in these areas for decades
- Embraced an ideology of "Republican universalism" that refused to acknowledge ethnic differences - making it impossible to even measure integration failures
- Allowed parallel societies to develop while pretending they didn't exist

**Germany's approach (2015):**
- Chancellor Merkel unilaterally declared "Wir schaffen das" (we can do this)
- Opened borders without consulting other EU countries
- Accepted over 1 million asylum seekers in a single year
- Had no plan for housing, integration, or security vetting
- Told Germans who objected they were on the wrong side of history

### The Numbers

```
Foreign-Born Population Growth
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Sweden:    14.3% (2010)  →  20.5% (2024)    +6.2 percentage points
France:     8.5% (2010)  →  11.0% (2024)    +2.5 percentage points
Germany:   13.0% (2010)  →  18.0% (2024)    +5.0 percentage points

Sweden now: 1 in 5 residents born abroad
            1 in 3 residents foreign-born or child of foreign-born
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

This wasn't gradual absorption. This was rapid demographic transformation without public consent.

## What Happened: Sweden

Sweden is the clearest case study because it went furthest and kept the best statistics.

### The Crime Explosion

Sweden went from one of the safest countries in Europe to having the worst gang violence on the continent.

**Gun homicides:**
- 2011: 17 shootings with injury/death, 4 deaths
- 2023: 53 shootings, 12 deaths
- **Tripled in 12 years**

Sweden now has the **highest gun homicide rate in the EU**. Higher than Italy. Higher than any country in Western Europe.

**Bombings:**
- 2016: ~40 explosions
- 2019: 257 explosions
- January 2025 alone: 32 explosions

Read that again. In January 2025, Sweden averaged more than one bombing per day. Hand grenades and improvised explosives, used by gangs for intimidation and territorial disputes.

**No other Western European country experiences anything like this.**

The Swedish Prime Minister admitted in April 2022:

> "Sweden has failed to integrate the vast numbers of immigrants it has taken in over the past two decades, leading to parallel societies and gang violence."

Swedish police estimate 62,000 people are connected to criminal networks. In a country of 10 million.

### Who Is Committing the Crimes?

Sweden's own crime statistics agency (Brå) documented:
- Foreign-born individuals: 2.5x overrepresentation in crime suspects
- Second-generation immigrants: 2x overrepresentation

Controlling for socioeconomic factors cuts these numbers roughly in half. But that means even after adjustment, significant overrepresentation remains.

This data was politically toxic. For years, Swedish authorities refused to collect or publish it. When Brå finally released updated figures in 2021, it confirmed what everyone already knew.

### The "No-Go Zones"

Sweden officially designates 59 "vulnerable areas" (utsatta områden). These are neighborhoods where:
- Police have difficulty operating
- Emergency services require escorts
- Criminal networks exercise de facto control
- Swedish law is not reliably enforced

The government doesn't call them "no-go zones." Everyone else does.

### Integration Failure by the Numbers

| Metric | Native Swedes | Foreign-Born (non-EU) |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Employment rate | 80% | 55-60% |
| Unemployment | 4% | 15-18% |
| Poverty rate | ~10% | ~36% |

The employment gap is 20-25 percentage points. For comparison, this is larger than the black-white employment gap in the United States.

## What Happened: France

France's problems are older and more entrenched. The banlieues have been burning periodically since the 1980s.

### The Pattern

Every few years, an incident - usually involving police and a young man of North African descent - triggers riots:

- **2005:** Three weeks of riots after two teenagers died fleeing police. 9,000 cars burned. State of emergency declared.
- **2023:** Six nights of nationwide riots after police shot 17-year-old Nahel M. 45,000 police deployed. Hundreds of buildings damaged.

These aren't spontaneous uprisings. They're the predictable result of concentrating disadvantaged populations in isolated suburbs with no economic prospects.

### The Segregation

France officially doesn't collect ethnic statistics - a legacy of post-WWII discomfort with racial classification. This makes it impossible to measure integration with precision.

But anyone who visits Paris knows the reality. The city center is wealthy and overwhelmingly white. The suburbs (Seine-Saint-Denis, etc.) are poor and overwhelmingly non-white. The commuter trains that connect them might as well cross international borders.

In these banlieues:
- Youth unemployment exceeds 30%
- Poverty rates are 2-3x the national average
- Educational outcomes lag far behind
- Police are viewed as occupying forces

### Crime Trends

France's crime picture is more mixed than Sweden's:

**Homicides:** Actually declined ~50% from 1990s levels. France's current rate (~1.3 per 100,000) is half what it was 30 years ago.

**Violent crime recordings:** Increased significantly since 2016, but interpretation is complicated by reporting changes.

**The 2023 riots:** Demonstrated that France has not solved its integration problem - just contained it in designated sacrifice zones.

## What Happened: The Economy

While social problems festered, Europe also fell behind economically.

### The US-EU Divergence

```
GDP Per Capita (2023)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

United States:  $76,000   ████████████████████████████████████████

EU Average:     $41,000   ██████████████████████

Gap: Americans are now ~85% richer per person
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

This gap has widened, not closed. In 2000, EU GDP per capita was ~70% of US levels. Now it's ~55%.

### The Draghi Verdict

In September 2024, former ECB President Mario Draghi delivered a report to the European Commission. His conclusion:

> "No EU company with a market capitalization over EUR 100 billion has been set up from scratch in the last fifty years."

Let that sink in. In half a century, Europe - with 450 million people, world-class universities, and massive government R&D spending - has produced zero major tech companies.

Meanwhile:
- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Nvidia (all American)
- Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance (all Chinese)
- Europe: Nothing

**Labor productivity growth (2010-2023):**
- US: +22%
- Eurozone: +5%

Europe isn't just falling behind. The gap is accelerating.

### Why This Matters for Immigration

A growing economy can absorb newcomers. A stagnant economy cannot.

When there are jobs, immigrants find work. When there are no jobs, immigrants collect welfare and their children grow up in poverty with no prospects. That's not a racial problem - it's an economic one.

Europe chose both: mass immigration AND economic stagnation. The combination was toxic.

## The Political Consequences

Voters noticed. And they responded.

### The Rise of the Right

```
Sweden Democrats Vote Share
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2010:    5.7%   ████
2014:   12.9%   ████████
2018:   17.5%   ███████████
2022:   20.5%   █████████████  (now government support partner)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

The Sweden Democrats went from a pariah party that mainstream politicians refused to acknowledge to the second-largest party in parliament and a formal partner of the governing coalition.

**Similar patterns across Europe:**
- France: National Rally at 32% in 2024 EU elections
- Germany: AfD surging, winning state elections
- Italy: Brothers of Italy now governing
- Netherlands: Geert Wilders' PVV leading coalition
- Austria: FPÖ winning recent elections

The "cordon sanitaire" - the agreement among mainstream parties to exclude the far-right from power - has collapsed.

### The Policy Reversal

Every major European country has now tightened immigration policy:

| Country | Policy Shift |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sweden** | Asylum seekers: 163,000 (2015) → 9,000 (2023). Now paying migrants $34,000 to leave. |
| **Denmark** | "Zero asylum seekers" goal. Offshore processing. |
| **Germany** | Border controls reinstated. Deportation acceleration. |
| **France** | 2024 immigration law with language requirements, tighter family reunification. |
| **EU** | New Migration Pact (2024) with stricter external border controls. |

The political mainstream spent 20 years calling these policies racist. Now they're implementing them.

---

## The Lesson

### What They Got Wrong

**1. They ignored incentives.**
If you provide generous welfare without work requirements, people won't work. This isn't racist - it's economics. It applies to native populations too.

**2. They ignored geography.**
Concentrating poor immigrants in isolated housing projects guaranteed segregation. You can't integrate people you've physically separated from the host society.

**3. They ignored culture.**
Not all cultural practices are compatible. Some source countries have very different norms around gender, religion, and authority. Pretending these differences don't exist doesn't make them disappear.

**4. They ignored time.**
Integration takes generations. Accepting large numbers in short periods overwhelms absorption capacity. There's a rate limit.

**5. They ignored consent.**
These policies were never put to a vote. When Brexit happened, the establishment was shocked. They shouldn't have been - it was the first time anyone asked.

### What They Got Right

Almost nothing. But to be fair:

- Unemployment in France and Sweden has improved recently
- Some immigrants have integrated successfully
- Second-generation outcomes are better than first-generation
- Europe remains safer than the United States overall

The situation is not hopeless. But fixing it requires acknowledging what went wrong.

## Where This Leaves Europe

### The Honest Assessment

**Sweden:** A wealthy, functional society with an acute gang violence problem concentrated in specific neighborhoods. Most Swedes see no daily impact. But the affected areas face genuine danger, and the problem is not being solved.

**France:** A country that has contained its integration failures in designated sacrifice zones (banlieues) while the rest of society functions normally. This is stable but not sustainable. The periodic riots are pressure releases.

**Germany:** Still processing the 2015 wave. Integration outcomes remain to be seen. Political backlash ongoing.

**EU economy:** Falling behind the US and losing ground to China. The competitiveness crisis is real and structural.

### The Path Forward

Europe's governments have now accepted what critics said for decades:
- Immigration must be controlled
- Integration must be enforced
- Welfare dependency must be addressed
- Parallel societies cannot be tolerated

The question is whether course correction came in time.

Sweden's gang networks are now multi-generational and deeply entrenched. France's banlieues have been neglected for 50 years. Germany is still figuring out what went wrong.

The problems were created over decades. They won't be solved in years.

---

## Conclusion

The story of European immigration policy is a story of elite consensus overriding democratic input, of ideological commitments trumping practical concerns, and of predictable problems being dismissed until they became undeniable.

The people who warned about these outcomes were called racists. The people who created these outcomes are still in charge.

The policies have been tried. The results are in.

Europe is now implementing the restrictive policies it should have adopted 20 years ago - except now it has millions of poorly-integrated residents, entrenched gang networks, and a generation of marginalized young men with no stake in society.

That's the inheritance. Whether it can be managed remains to be seen.
