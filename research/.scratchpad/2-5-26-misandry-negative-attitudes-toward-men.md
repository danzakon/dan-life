## Executive Summary

The question "do people hate men?" is actually several different questions masquerading as one, and the research answers them very differently depending on which one you're asking.

If the question is "do feminists hate men?" -- the answer is an unambiguous no. Forty years of empirical research, culminating in a 9,799-person cross-cultural study published in 2024, shows feminists hold *positive* attitudes toward men that are statistically indistinguishable from non-feminists'. The "man-hating feminist" is one of the largest documented gaps between a social stereotype and measured reality in the intergroup attitudes literature.

But if the question is "does society systematically show less empathy for men's suffering?" -- the answer appears to be yes, and the evidence is stronger than most people realize. Men receive 63% longer prison sentences for identical crimes. People are more willing to inflict instrumental harm on men. Male pain is underestimated. Male victims of domestic violence are arrested when they call the police. Boys face grading bias in schools. These are findings from PNAS, JPSP, Nature, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission -- not fringe sources.

The two literatures largely talk past each other. The feminist-attitudes research measures *affective evaluation* ("how do you feel about men?"). The empathy gap research measures *behavioral responses to harm* ("what do you do when a man suffers?"). Both appear to be correct within their own domain, and the tension between them is where the real insight lives: society can simultaneously like men as a category while treating individual men's suffering as less important. This paradox -- high regard, low protection -- is the actual story the research tells.

## Background

### What "Misandry" Means (and Doesn't)

Misandry -- hatred or prejudice against men -- entered the English language around 1885, coined as a mirror of "misogyny." Its appearance coincided precisely with the suffrage movement. This is not a coincidence. According to [Sutton et al. (2024)](https://sydneysymposium.unsw.edu.au/2024/chapters/SuttonSSSP2024.pdf), politicians and propagandists portrayed suffragettes as "ugly, mannish, driven to usurp men's role in society, and fired by resentment and contempt for men: in short, by misandry. It was indeed at around this time (in 1885) that this term was coined."

From its inception, the concept has served dual purposes: describing a real (if rare) prejudice, and functioning as a rhetorical weapon against feminist advocacy. This duality makes it unusually difficult to study. Depending on who's using the word, "misandry" can mean anything from genuine hatred of individual men to structural critique of patriarchal systems to ironic feminist humor. The academic literature treats these as fundamentally different phenomena -- popular discourse collapses them into one.

### The Research Landscape

The academic study of attitudes toward men splits into two largely separate literatures that rarely cite each other:

```
LITERATURE 1:                          LITERATURE 2:
"Do feminists hate men?"               "Does society undervalue men?"

Journals: Psychology of Women          Journals: Archives of Sexual Behavior,
Quarterly, JPSP                        American Law & Economics Review,
                                       Biology Letters
Authors: Glick, Fiske, Hopkins-Doyle,
Anderson, Sutton                       Authors: Starr, Graso, Reynolds,
                                       Vandello, Seager, Barry
Finding: No. Feminists hold positive
attitudes toward men.                  Finding: Yes. Behavioral evidence of
                                       reduced empathy for male suffering.
```

Both literatures are internally well-supported. The disconnect between them is itself informative.

### Key Measurement Tools

## Do Feminists Actually Hate Men?

### The Landmark Study

The most comprehensive study on this question was published in 2024 in the APA's *Psychology of Women Quarterly*:

**Hopkins-Doyle, A., Petterson, A. L., Leach, S., et al. (2024).** "The misandry myth: An inaccurate stereotype about feminists' attitudes toward men." [*Psychology of Women Quarterly, 48*(1), 8-37.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2024-50799-001)

The study was massive: 9,799 participants across 9 countries (US, UK, China, South Korea, India, Japan, Taiwan, Poland), including two nationally representative samples. Five studies plus a meta-analysis. They used feeling thermometers, trust measures, liking scales, *and* implicit association tests -- covering both what people say they feel and what their automatic associations reveal.

The results:

| Measure | Effect Size | What It Means |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Feminists' attitudes toward men vs. neutral | d = 0.73 above neutral | Clearly positive -- not ambivalent, not neutral, *positive* |
| Feminist vs. non-feminist attitudes | d = -0.07 | No meaningful difference |
| Implicit attitudes (feminists) | d = 0.71 | Positive automatic associations too |
| How people *think* feminists feel | d = -0.22 (below neutral) | Public thinks feminists dislike men |
| Size of the misperception | d = -0.95 | Nearly a full standard deviation of error |

That last number is striking. The gap between what people believe feminists think about men and what feminists actually think is one of the largest documented stereotype-reality gaps in the social psychology literature. And it's not just non-feminists who get it wrong -- feminists themselves massively underestimate how positively their fellow feminists feel about men.

The study also found that feminists who liked women more also liked men more (r = .46). The public assumes this correlation is zero -- that liking women comes at men's expense. It doesn't. The orientation is positive-sum, not zero-sum.

### The Earlier Evidence (It's Been Consistent for 40 Years)

| Year | Study | N | Key Finding |
|------|-------|---|-------------|
| 1983 | [Iazzo](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01122508) | 28 NOW members + controls | NOW members' attitudes toward men no different from non-members |
| 1999 | [Henderson-King & Stewart](https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167299025003011) | College women | Women's studies courses did not increase dislike of men |
| 2001 | [Maltby & Day](https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980109603703) | UK adults | More *traditionally feminine* women had more negative attitudes toward men -- not feminists |
| 2004 | [Glick et al.](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.713) | 8,360 across 16 nations | Hostility toward men correlated with national gender *inequality*, not feminist ideology |
| 2009 | [Anderson, Kanner & Elsayegh](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/5173/pwq2009.pdf) | 488 | Non-feminists scored *higher* on hostility toward men than feminists |
| 2024 | [Hopkins-Doyle et al.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2024-50799-001) | 9,799 across 9 countries | Feminists hold positive attitudes; stereotype is inaccurate |

The consistency is remarkable. Across four decades, multiple measurement instruments, diverse samples, and different cultural contexts, the finding replicates: feminists do not hate men. This isn't a single study you can dismiss -- it's a convergent evidence base.

### The AMI: What "Hostility Toward Men" Actually Measures

A critical subtlety: the Ambivalence toward Men Inventory, the most widely used measure in this literature, doesn't measure pure negative affect. It measures resentment of systemic power dynamics. The Hostility toward Men subscale includes items like:

- "When men act to 'help' women, they are often trying to prove they are better than women"
- "Most men pay lip service to equality for women, but can't handle having a woman as an equal"
- "Men act like babies when they are sick"

Scoring low on these items means rejecting gender stereotypes about male behavior, not necessarily expressing warmth. Scoring high means endorsing stereotypes about male power abuse and domestic incompetence -- which, as [Glick et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.713) showed, actually correlates with *more traditional gender role adherence*, not with feminism.

This is why non-feminist women score higher: they're more embedded in traditional gender dynamics where they simultaneously depend on men and resent male dominance. Feminists, who tend to see men and women as more similar, reject these stereotyped framings.

---

## Where Hostility Toward Men Really Comes From

### The "Bad but Bold" Paradox

The most important finding in the cross-cultural literature comes from [Glick et al.'s 16-nation study (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.713): **hostility toward men is higher in more unequal societies, not more feminist ones.**

This seems counterintuitive until you understand the mechanism. In societies with sharp gender hierarchies:

```
Men hold institutional power  ──►  Women resent this (Hostility toward Men)
         │
     BUT ALSO
         │
Women depend on men           ──►  Women idealize provider/protector roles
for provision/protection            (Benevolence toward Men)
         │
         ▼
AMBIVALENCE: "Men are bad but bold"
(aggressive and arrogant, yet competent and essential)
```

Both hostility and benevolence toward men are elevated in traditional societies. They're two sides of the same coin. The resentment ("men abuse their power") coexists with idealization ("men should protect and provide"). This combination doesn't threaten the gender hierarchy -- it *reinforces* it.

At the individual level, hostile and benevolent attitudes toward men correlate at about r = 0.4. At the national level, [the correlation approaches r = 0.9](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Shared%20Documents/conferences/2013-w50-research-symposium/glick.pdf). Nations with high hostility toward men almost perfectly predict high benevolence toward men. The two travel together because they emerge from the same structural conditions.

### System Justification: Why Inequality Persists Despite Resentment

[Jost & Kay (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.88.3.498) ran three experiments showing that exposing people to complementary gender stereotypes -- "men are powerful but cold; women are warm but lack power" -- *increased* system justification among women. The balanced-advantages illusion ("each gender has something") makes the status quo seem fair even when it isn't.

This means hostility toward men in traditional societies doesn't translate into action against gender hierarchy. Women in the most sexist nations are simultaneously most hostile toward men *and* most accepting of benevolent sexism toward themselves. The resentment is contained by the dependence.

### Equality Makes People Like Men More

Here's the finding that should settle the popular debate about whether feminism breeds hostility toward men:

[Krys et al. (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28295294/) studied the "women-are-wonderful" effect (people evaluate women more positively than men) across **44 cultures**. They found:

1. The effect is real and widespread
2. **It shrinks in more gender-egalitarian societies**
3. Men's social perception benefits *more* from egalitarianism than women's does
4. The gap closes because men are evaluated more positively in equal societies, not because women are evaluated less positively

Their direct quote: "the social perception of men benefits more from gender egalitarianism than that of women."

A [2025 meta-analysis in *Psychological Bulletin*](https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000485.supp) confirmed that both hostile and benevolent sexism have been declining globally over time, correlated with reductions in gender inequality.

The relationship is the opposite of what's popularly assumed: **equality makes people like men more, not less.**

### The Generational Picture: Complex, Not Simple

Recent Ipsos surveys across 31 countries show a real and widening gap -- but not where most commentary places it:

| Finding | Gen Z Men | Gen Z Women | Boomers |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| "Promoting women's equality discriminates against men" | 60% agree | 40% agree | ~35% agree |
| "Men are being asked to do too much for equality" | 54% | -- | 43% |
| "Things have gone far enough on women's rights" | 57% | -- | 43% |

Source: [Ipsos Global 31-Country Survey, March 2024](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/millennials-and-gen-z-less-favour-gender-equality-older-generations)

But [YouGov UK (October 2025)](https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/52863-young-men-masculinity-and-misogyny) found that potentially misogynistic views among young men are "often not held at a rate significantly higher than among their elders." Young men are "often more likely to hold more progressive gender attitudes than their older male peers."

The story isn't that young men are becoming more hostile. It's that the *within-generation gender gap* is widening: young women are becoming more feminist than any prior cohort, while young men increasingly feel equality efforts are zero-sum. The divergence is about *perception of fairness*, not about attitudes toward the other gender per se.

## The Gender Empathy Gap: The Understudied Side

This is where the research gets uncomfortable for everyone. A separate body of evidence -- published in mainstream journals, using rigorous methods -- documents systematic disparities in how society responds to male versus female suffering.

### Sentencing: The Largest Gender Gap Nobody Talks About

[Sonja Starr's landmark 2012 study](https://repository.law.umich.edu/law_econ_current/57/) (University of Michigan/Chicago Law) analyzed federal criminal cases from 1998-2009:

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Average sentence length gap | **Men receive 63% longer sentences** than women for comparable crimes |
| Avoidance of incarceration | Women twice as likely to avoid prison |
| Avoidance of charges entirely | Women significantly more likely |

For context: the well-documented racial sentencing gap (Black-white) is approximately 20%. The gender gap is three times larger. The [U.S. Sentencing Commission confirmed these disparities in 2017 and 2023](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf).

### Moral Typecasting: The Cognitive Bias Underneath

[Reynolds et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.05.002) published six studies across four countries (N = 3,137) in *Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes* showing a deep cognitive bias:

- When people imagine a victim, they automatically imagine a woman
- When people imagine a perpetrator, they automatically imagine a man
- Animated shapes doing harm are perceived as male; shapes receiving harm as female
- Identical harassment claims receive more sympathy when filed by women
- Firing a female employee is perceived as less moral than firing a male employee

This isn't ideology. It's a pre-existing cognitive architecture that automatically assigns men to the "agent/perpetrator" category and women to the "patient/victim" category. [Graso & Reynolds (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532144/) showed this extends to trolley-problem scenarios: people are less willing to sacrifice women, particularly women of reproductive age -- suggesting an evolutionary component.

### Instrumental Harm: Who Is It Acceptable to Hurt?

[Graso, Reynolds & Aquino (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02571-0) ran three pre-registered experiments and found people more readily accept interventions that inflict instrumental harm on men than on women. Women showed a *greater* asymmetry than men. Even in domains where women have traditionally been expected to sacrifice more (caregiving), participants still more readily accepted harm to men. They tried to find contexts where the bias would reverse and could not.

### Pain Perception

[Robinson & Wise (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3959(03)00014-9), published in *Pain*: viewers rated male video participants as having less pain than female participants, with male pain underestimated by 22 points on a 0-100 scale versus 14 points for female pain.

Though it's worth noting [Zhang et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2021.03.001) found the opposite direction for some measures -- female patients' pain was underestimated when stereotypes about women being "more expressive" led perceivers to discount female expressions. The picture is genuinely complex.

### Male Domestic Violence Victims

[Douglas & Hines (2011)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3175099/) studied 302 men who experienced severe intimate partner violence from female partners:

- When men called police, police were **more likely to arrest the male victim** than the female perpetrator
- Domestic violence hotlines offered **batterer intervention resources** to male callers -- treating the victim as the abuser
- DV agencies were reported as unhelpful and sometimes hostile

[Bates (2019)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-12086-001) in the APA's *Psychology of Men & Masculinities*: male victims report pervasive disbelief and minimization. The title says it: "'No One Would Ever Believe Me.'"

### Education: Grading Bias and the Boy Gap

[Camille Terrier (2020)](https://mitili.mit.edu/sites/default/files/project-documents/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.07-Terrier.pdf), an MIT/NBER economist, compared blind test scores with teacher-assigned grades in French middle schools:

- Teachers favor girls by approximately **6% in math grades** for equivalent performance
- This bias accounts for **21% of boys falling behind girls in math** during middle school
- The effect cascades: girls who benefit from the bias are more likely to choose science tracks

The [APA formally recognized boys' educational challenges in 2023](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/04/boys-school-challenges-recommendations). The [World Bank documented the global pattern in 2021](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/111041644611110155/pdf/Educational-Underachievement-Among-Boys-and-Men.pdf).

### Precarious Manhood

[Vandello & Bosson (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0012453), published in JPSP (the top journal in social psychology), demonstrated across five studies that:

- Manhood is perceived as a *precarious social status* -- hard earned, easily lost
- Womanhood is perceived as more permanent and biological
- When masculinity is threatened, men show increased anxiety and aggression
- Threats can be trivial (being asked to braid hair) or significant (job loss)

This creates a unique male vulnerability: the constant pressure to "prove" masculinity drives harmful behaviors (risk-taking, aggression, substance use) *and* prevents adaptive ones (seeking help, expressing vulnerability, caregiving). The asymmetry between how manhood and womanhood are socially constructed is well-documented across 62 nations.

### The Framework Question: Strong Data, Contested Interpretation

Here's the critical assessment: the **individual empirical findings** above are published in top-tier journals (PNAS, JPSP, Nature, APA journals, *Pain*, the U.S. Sentencing Commission). They're robust.

The **overarching frameworks** that attempt to unify them -- "male disposability," "gamma bias," "the gender empathy gap" as a named concept -- are less established. [Seager & Barry's "gamma bias" (2019)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5) was published in a Palgrave handbook and featured in the British Psychological Society's magazine, but has only 16 citations. Warren Farrell's work is published through mainstream publishers but sits outside academic consensus. The data points are often stronger than the theories built on them.

The one framework that bridges both literatures is [Susan Fiske's own recent work](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11804649/). In a 2025 paper in PNAS -- co-authored by the woman who *created* ambivalent sexism theory -- Fiske now argues explicitly that gendered arrangements harm men through five mechanisms: restrictive masculine norms, disengagement from communal roles, hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and identity threat from shifting hierarchies. When the architect of the field's dominant framework starts writing about how the system hurts men too, it's worth paying attention.

## Misandry Online: Real Phenomenon, Contested Meaning

### The Research Asymmetry

Google Scholar returns approximately 150,000 results for "online misogyny" and approximately 19,600 for "online misandry" -- a 7.5:1 ratio. This reflects both the real scale difference and the academic consensus that online misogyny is a larger phenomenon with more documented real-world consequences.

### Structural Comparison

[Coppolillo (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81567-9) in *Scientific Reports* (Nature) analyzed four Reddit communities -- two classified as misandric (r/Feminism, r/GenderCritical) and two as misogynistic (r/Incels, r/MensRights):

| Metric | Misogynistic Communities | Misandric Communities |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Text-level toxicity | **Higher** (especially r/Incels) | Lower |
| User-level "hate" emotion | Lower | **Higher** (especially r/Feminism) |
| Graph structure/modularity | Similar | Similar |
| Systematic differences | None observed holistically | None observed holistically |

The central finding: gendered hate speech is "not exacerbated by the perpetrator's gender" -- it's a feature of toxic communities regardless of target direction. The structures, linguistic patterns, and emotional dynamics are broadly similar.

But the real-world consequences are not symmetric. Online misogyny has been directly linked to multiple mass violence events (Isla Vista 2014, Toronto 2018, Plymouth 2021). No comparable mass violence events have been attributed to online misandry. This asymmetry matters.

### Ironic Misandry: Strategy, Not Sentiment

"Male tears" mugs, #KillAllMen, Pauline Harmange's viral book *I Hate Men* (2020) -- these phenomena are well-documented in the academic literature as rhetorical strategies, not expressions of genuine attitudes.

[Ringrose & Lawrence (2018)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-59781-6_8) identified three functions of "ironic misandry":

1. **In-group solidarity** -- bonding through shared absurdist humor
2. **Subversive commentary** -- the humor works *because* misandry lacks the structural backing that misogyny has
3. **Deliberate provocation** -- exposing asymmetric reactions (the outrage over a "male tears" mug proves the point)

[Vedie (2021)](https://shs.hal.science/halshs-03328472v1/document) applied stigma-reversal theory: ironic misandry reclaims the accusation, neutralizing its power as a silencing tool. [Hedges (2024)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01417789231223202) in *Feminist Review* proposed an important three-part distinction:

| Category | Description | Is It Misandry? |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Structural critique of masculine power | Analysis of patriarchy, institutions | No, even when harsh |
| Emotional response to gendered oppression | Post-assault anger, trauma responses | Context-dependent |
| Actual prejudice against individual men | Genuine hatred based on gender | Yes, but empirically rare among feminists |

Popular discourse collapses these categories. The academic literature insists they're fundamentally different.

### Platform Moderation Asymmetry

[Nurik (2019)](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/download/9608/2697) documented an interesting finding: Facebook removed posts containing "Men Are Scum" (a South African feminist hashtag protesting gender-based violence) under hate speech policies while equivalent or worse misogynistic content remained. This "gender-based censorship" likely results from algorithmic detection -- explicit statements like "men are scum" are easier to flag than structural misogyny, which tends to be more implicit and diffuse.

## Who Benefits From the Man-Hating Stereotype

### A 140-Year-Old Weapon

The "man-hating feminist" stereotype is not new. [Sutton et al. (2024)](https://sydneysymposium.unsw.edu.au/2024/chapters/SuttonSSSP2024.pdf) trace it to the suffrage era: "Politicians and propagandists portrayed suffragettes as ugly, mannish, driven to usurp men's role in society, and fired by resentment and contempt for men." The stereotypes attached to those early feminists are "eerily familiar to us today" -- they have survived virtually unchanged for approximately 140 years despite dramatic changes in women's circumstances.

Rush Limbaugh's "feminazi" coinage (1992) industrialized the framing for a modern audience of 20 million weekly listeners. As [biographer John K. Wilson documented](https://books.google.com/books?id=_qiEDwAAQBAJ), Limbaugh initially claimed the term applied to "probably no more than 25" women, then proceeded to apply it to Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Anita Hill, a rally of 500,000 people, and eventually used "feminists" and "feminazis" interchangeably.

### Five Functions of the Stereotype

The research converges on the stereotype serving five interconnected political functions:

| Function | Mechanism | Key Evidence |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Delegitimize** | Convert political claims into personal pathology ("you're just angry at men") | [Hedges 2024](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01417789231223202); [Huang 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2022.2129412) |
| **Deter** | Prevent women from adopting the feminist label | [Roy et al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2007.00351.x); [Moore & Stathi 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31322058/) |
| **Divide** | Separate women with feminist beliefs from organized action | [Zucker 2010](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00673.x); [Anastosopoulos 2015](https://doi.org/10.1111/jasp.12290) |
| **Deflect** | Redirect from structural inequality to feminists' emotions | [Bashir et al. 2013](https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Citation2371_The%20Ironic%20Impact%20of%20Activists%20-%20Negative%20Stereotypes%20Reduce%20Social%20Change%20Influence.pdf); [Rothermel 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517221145671) |
| **Mobilize** | Provide grievance narrative for anti-feminist counter-movements | [James 2024](https://doi.org/10.1177/1097184X241227990); [Ging 2019](https://doi.org/10.1177/1097184X17706401) |

### The Deterrent Effect Is Experimentally Proven

[Roy, Weibust & Miller (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2007.00351.x) ran an experiment: college women randomly assigned to hear positive stereotypes, negative stereotypes, or no stereotypes about feminists. Women exposed to negative stereotypes were significantly less likely to identify as feminist. This is causal evidence.

[Bashir et al. (2013)](https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Citation2371_The%20Ironic%20Impact%20of%20Activists%20-%20Negative%20Stereotypes%20Reduce%20Social%20Change%20Influence.pdf) showed the effect goes further: when the same pro-equality behaviors were advocated by a "typical feminist" versus an undefined person, participants were *least* motivated to adopt those behaviors from the stereotyped source. The stereotype doesn't just suppress identity -- it suppresses the actual pro-equality behaviors feminism promotes.

[Anastosopoulos (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jasp.12290) tested whether the stigma attaches to the feminist label or to feminist deeds. It's the label: a person who advocates gender equality without using the word "feminist" receives less backlash than one who does the same while identifying as feminist.

### The Manosphere's Ironic Self-Misandry

One of the more pointed observations from [Sutton et al. (2024)](https://sydneysymposium.unsw.edu.au/2024/chapters/SuttonSSSP2024.pdf):

> "The so-called 'manosphere'... is also notable for its *misandrist* language. Men are labelled contemptuously as 'cucks' or 'betas' if they are perceived to be socially or sexually unsuccessful and as 'Chads' if they are perceived to be socially and sexually successful. When it occurs, misandry is not unique to or characteristic of feminism."

The communities that most loudly accuse feminists of hating men are themselves some of the most prolific producers of anti-male rhetoric. The alpha/beta/incel taxonomy is itself a system of contempt for most men. [Rothermel (2023)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517221145671) calls this "evidence-based misogyny" -- selectively citing statistics (men's higher suicide rates, sentencing disparities) not to help men but to build opposition to feminism.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The "man-hating feminist" is empirically false.** Four decades of research (1983-2024), culminating in a 9,799-person, 9-country study, shows feminists hold positive attitudes toward men indistinguishable from non-feminists'. The stereotype is almost a full standard deviation removed from measured reality.

2. **Hostility toward men comes from traditional gender roles, not feminism.** More unequal societies show more hostility toward men. More egalitarian societies show less. Gender equality literally makes people like men more (Krys et al., 2018, 44 cultures). The feminist project and the "help men" project are not in tension -- they're the same direction.

3. **But the gender empathy gap is real and documented in serious journals.** Sentencing disparities (63%), pain underestimation, moral typecasting, domestic violence victim mistreatment, educational grading bias -- these are findings from PNAS, JPSP, Nature, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Dismissing them is as intellectually dishonest as claiming feminists hate men.

4. **The two findings are not contradictory.** Society can simultaneously evaluate men positively as a category while systematically discounting individual men's suffering. "We like men" and "we don't care when men are hurt" can both be true. The mechanism is benevolent sexism: viewing men as strong, agentic, and resilient means their pain registers as less urgent. The same ideology that puts men on a pedestal of competence also removes them from the category of people who need protection.

5. **Online misandry and misogyny are structurally similar, but their real-world consequences are asymmetric.** No mass violence events have been attributed to misandric communities. Multiple have been attributed to misogynistic ones. This does not mean online misandry is harmless, but it does mean false equivalences are dangerous.

6. **The man-hating stereotype is a weapon with a 140-year track record.** It suppresses feminist identification, prevents collective action, and converts structural critique into character attack. It benefits anti-feminist movements more than it reflects any reality about feminist attitudes. The communities that deploy it most aggressively are themselves prolific producers of anti-male rhetoric.

7. **The individual data points on male disadvantage are often stronger than the frameworks built on them.** Teacher grading bias, sentencing disparities, and the women-are-wonderful effect are rock-solid findings. "Male disposability" and "gamma bias" as unified theories are less established. The responsible position is to take the empirical findings seriously while holding the grand narratives more loosely.

8. **Susan Fiske now writes about how gendered arrangements harm men.** When the co-creator of ambivalent sexism theory publishes in PNAS (2025) arguing that the system she documented hurts men through restrictive norms, disengagement from communal roles, and identity threat, it represents a meaningful convergence of the two literatures. The mainstream of gender psychology is moving toward integration.

## Predictions

1. **The two literatures will converge within 5 years.** Fiske's 2025 PNAS paper signals the beginning. The feminist-attitudes researchers and the empathy-gap researchers are studying different manifestations of the same underlying system. Ambivalent sexism theory already has the theoretical architecture to accommodate both -- it just hasn't been fully deployed in that direction yet.

2. **"Ironic misandry" will decline as a rhetorical strategy.** The generational data shows young men increasingly feeling that equality efforts are zero-sum. In that environment, ironic misandry stops functioning as subversive humor and starts functioning as confirmation of the grievance narrative. Strategic feminists will recognize this and pivot.

3. **The gender empathy gap will become a mainstream research program within the decade.** The individual findings (sentencing, pain perception, moral typecasting) are too robust to stay siloed. The barrier is framing -- the concept is currently associated with men's rights advocacy, which deters mainstream researchers. Once the framing shifts (Fiske's approach -- "gendered arrangements harm everyone" -- provides the template), the research will proliferate.

4. **The within-generation gender gap will be the defining social tension of the 2030s.** Young women becoming more feminist while young men feel equality is zero-sum is a structural divergence with implications for dating, politics, workplace dynamics, and mental health. Neither side of the current discourse has a framework adequate to this challenge. Whoever builds one will shape the next era of gender politics.

5. **The manosphere will lose influence as its internal contradictions become more visible.** A movement that claims to care about men while labeling most men as "betas" and "cucks" -- while opposing the very equality that empirically makes people like men more -- has a structural coherence problem. This won't collapse the movement, but it will limit its ceiling.
