## The Fundamental Shift

The transition from IC to manager is not a promotion—it's a career change.

**The hardest part:** Letting go of the dopamine hit from solving technical problems yourself. Your job is now to create the conditions for others to have that experience.

## The Three Jobs of a Manager

Everything you do falls into one of three buckets:

```
┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│                  │  │                  │  │                  │
│    PEOPLE        │  │    PROCESS       │  │    RESULTS       │
│                  │  │                  │  │                  │
│  Hiring          │  │  How work gets   │  │  Shipping        │
│  Developing      │  │  done            │  │  Quality         │
│  Retaining       │  │  Standards       │  │  Client success  │
│  Exiting         │  │  Communication   │  │  Business impact │
│                  │  │  Coordination    │  │                  │
└──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
        │                     │                     │
        └─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┘
                              │
                    All three matter.
              You can't ignore any of them.
```

New managers often focus too much on Results (because it feels familiar) and neglect People and Process until there's a crisis.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Is Kindness

Ambiguity is not kindness—it's cowardice. People deserve to know:

- Where they stand
- What's expected of them
- Where they're going
- What "good" looks like

**In practice:**
- Give direct feedback, even when uncomfortable
- Set explicit expectations, not implied ones
- Tell people if they're at risk before it's too late
- Be clear about promotion criteria and timeline

**The test:** Could someone quote back to you what's expected of them? If not, you haven't been clear enough.

---

### 2. Context Over Control

Your job is not to tell people what to do. Your job is to give them enough context to make good decisions themselves.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                     │
│   LOW CONTEXT                       HIGH CONTEXT                    │
│   (Micromanagement)                 (Empowerment)                   │
│   ─────────────────                 ─────────────────               │
│                                                                     │
│   "Do X, then Y, then Z"            "Here's the goal, the           │
│                                      constraints, and why it        │
│                                      matters. How would you         │
│                                      approach it?"                  │
│                                                                     │
│   You make decisions                They make decisions             │
│   They execute                      You support                     │
│                                                                     │
│   Doesn't scale                     Scales                          │
│   Kills ownership                   Builds ownership                │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What context includes:**
- Why this work matters (business impact)
- Who cares about it (stakeholders)
- What constraints exist (time, budget, dependencies)
- What success looks like
- What's already been tried or decided

---

### 3. Feedback Is a Gift

The best thing you can do for someone's growth is tell them the truth about how they're doing—frequently and specifically.

**The Feedback Formula (Lara Hogan):**

```
Observation + Impact + Question = Actionable Feedback
```

| Component | What It Is | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Observation | Specific, objective behavior you noticed | "In yesterday's client call, you interrupted Sarah twice while she was explaining the technical approach." |
| Impact | Why it matters—effect on team, project, perception | "It made it harder for her to finish her thought, and the client seemed confused about who was leading." |
| Question | Opens dialogue, invites their perspective | "Can you help me understand what was going on for you in that moment?" |

**Common mistakes:**
- Waiting too long (feedback should be timely, not saved for reviews)
- Being vague ("you need to communicate better")
- Sandwiching criticism between fake praise
- Avoiding it entirely because it's uncomfortable

---

### 4. Praise Publicly, Criticize Privately

**Public praise:**
- Be specific about what they did and why it mattered
- Don't dilute it with "but" or caveats
- Make it visible to people who matter (leadership, clients)

**Private criticism:**
- Never embarrass someone in front of others
- Have the hard conversation 1:1
- Give them a chance to respond and explain

---

### 5. Your Calendar Is Your Strategy

How you spend your time reveals your actual priorities, regardless of what you say your priorities are.

**Time audit questions:**
- How much time do you spend with your direct reports vs. in other meetings?
- How much time do you spend on urgent vs. important work?
- When did you last have a career conversation (not just status update) with each report?

**Recommendations:**
- Protect 1:1 time ruthlessly—don't cancel or reschedule constantly
- Block time for thinking, not just doing
- If you're in >25 hours of meetings/week, something is wrong

---

## 1:1s

The most important meeting you have. Non-negotiable.

### Purpose

1:1s are **their time**, not yours. The purpose is:
- Build relationship and trust
- Surface issues early
- Provide coaching and support
- Remove blockers
- Give and receive feedback

**Not the purpose:** Status updates. That's what standups and async tools are for.

### Cadence and Duration

| Report Type | Frequency | Duration |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| New to role/team | Weekly | 45-60 min |
| Established, performing well | Weekly | 30 min |
| Senior, high autonomy | Weekly or bi-weekly | 30 min |

Weekly is the default. Going less frequent than bi-weekly is risky—you lose touch with what's really happening.

### Structure

Don't over-structure, but have a skeleton:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1:1 STRUCTURE                                                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                     │
│  1. THEM FIRST (10-15 min)                                          │
│     "What's on your mind?"                                          │
│     Let them drive. Listen more than you talk.                      │
│                                                                     │
│  2. COACHING (10-15 min)                                            │
│     Feedback, development, working through challenges               │
│     Ask questions more than give answers                            │
│                                                                     │
│  3. LOGISTICS (5 min)                                               │
│     Anything you need to cover                                      │
│     Updates, decisions, FYIs                                        │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Good Questions to Ask

**Opening:**
- "What's on your mind?"
- "What's the most important thing we should talk about today?"

**Probing:**
- "What's going well that I should know about?"
- "What's not going well that I can help with?"
- "What's the hardest part of your current work?"

**Development:**
- "What do you want to be doing in a year that you're not doing now?"
- "What skill do you most want to develop?"
- "What would make this job more fulfilling?"

**Meta:**
- "What's something I could do differently to support you better?"
- "Is there anything you're not telling me that I should know?"

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Constant rescheduling | Signals they're not a priority | Protect the time; if you must move it, reschedule immediately |
| You talk the whole time | It's their meeting, not yours | Aim for 70% them, 30% you |
| Only tactical/status | Misses the relationship and development | Separate status updates from 1:1s |
| No follow-through | Breaks trust when you don't do what you said | Write down commitments; review at next 1:1 |

---

## Helping People Grow

### The Growth Framework

Growth happens at the intersection of challenge and support:

```
                        HIGH CHALLENGE
                              │
           Anxiety Zone       │       Growth Zone
           (Overwhelmed)      │       (Stretching)
                              │
      ────────────────────────┼────────────────────────
                              │
           Apathy Zone        │       Comfort Zone
           (Checked out)      │       (Coasting)
                              │
                        LOW CHALLENGE

      LOW SUPPORT ───────────────────────── HIGH SUPPORT
```

**Your job:** Keep people in the Growth Zone.
- Too much challenge without support → anxiety, burnout
- Support without challenge → stagnation, boredom
- Neither → apathy, disengagement

### Types of Growth

Not everyone wants the same growth:

| Growth Type | What It Looks Like | How to Support |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Depth** | Becoming an expert in their domain | Harder problems, learning opportunities, mentorship from experts |
| **Breadth** | Expanding skills across areas | Cross-functional projects, new technologies, rotation |
| **Scope** | Taking on bigger responsibilities | Larger projects, leadership opportunities, visibility |
| **Impact** | Affecting more of the business | Strategic work, client exposure, decision-making authority |
| **People** | Leading and developing others | Mentorship roles, tech lead opportunities, eventually management |

**Ask them:** "What kind of growth is most interesting to you right now?" Don't assume.

### Stretch Assignments

The best development happens through work, not training.

**Good stretch assignments:**
- Leading a project slightly beyond current scope
- Presenting to a client or stakeholder group
- Mentoring a junior engineer
- Owning a technical decision with real consequences
- Representing the team in cross-functional work

**How to set up a stretch assignment:**
1. Be explicit that it's a stretch: "This will be challenging. That's intentional."
2. Define success clearly: "Here's what good looks like."
3. Provide support: "I'll check in weekly. Here's who can help."
4. Create safety: "If it's not working, we'll figure it out together."

### The Career Conversation

Different from a regular 1:1. Dedicated time (quarterly) to talk about trajectory.

**Questions to explore:**
- "Where do you want to be in 2 years? 5 years?"
- "What does the next level look like for you?"
- "What's standing between where you are and where you want to be?"
- "What experiences are you missing?"
- "How can I help you get there?"

**Output:** A shared understanding of their goals and a rough plan to work toward them.

---

## Career Progression

### Levels and Expectations

Make the ladder explicit. People should know:
- What level they're at
- What's expected at their current level
- What's required for the next level
- What gaps they need to close

### Promotion Readiness

Promotion should be **recognition of consistent performance at the next level**, not a reward for potential.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                     │
│  WRONG: "You've been doing great at your current level. Here's     │
│          a promotion to see if you can handle more."                │
│                                                                     │
│  RIGHT: "You've been consistently operating at the next level      │
│          for the past 6 months. The promotion makes it official."   │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implication:** Your job is to give people opportunities to demonstrate next-level work *before* the promotion.

### When Someone Isn't Ready

Be honest and specific:

- "Here's what's expected at the next level: [X, Y, Z]"
- "Here's where you're strong: [A, B]"
- "Here's where you need to grow: [C]"
- "Here's what demonstrating C would look like"
- "Let's create opportunities to work on C"

Vague feedback ("you're not quite ready yet") is useless and frustrating.

## Performance Problems

### Early Warning Signs

Catch problems early:
- Deadlines slipping without early warning
- Quality declining
- Communication decreasing
- Engagement dropping (missing meetings, less participation)
- Conflict with teammates increasing
- Feedback being deflected or dismissed

### The Conversation Framework

When you need to address underperformance:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                     │
│  1. STATE THE PROBLEM                                               │
│     Be direct. Specific examples. No softening.                     │
│     "I've noticed X, Y, Z. This is a problem because..."            │
│                                                                     │
│  2. LISTEN                                                          │
│     There may be context you don't have.                            │
│     "Help me understand what's going on."                           │
│                                                                     │
│  3. ALIGN ON EXPECTATIONS                                           │
│     Be explicit about what needs to change.                         │
│     "Going forward, I need to see..."                               │
│                                                                     │
│  4. AGREE ON SUPPORT                                                │
│     What will you do to help?                                       │
│     "Here's how I can support you..."                               │
│                                                                     │
│  5. SET A TIMELINE                                                  │
│     When will you check in? What's the deadline for improvement?    │
│     "Let's check in weekly. In 30 days, I need to see..."           │
│                                                                     │
│  6. DOCUMENT                                                        │
│     Write it down. Send a follow-up email summarizing.              │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When to Escalate

If after clear feedback and support:
- No improvement in the agreed timeline
- Defensive or dismissive response to feedback
- Same issues recurring despite conversations

...it's time for a formal performance improvement plan (PIP) or separation conversation. Don't let it drag on—it's not fair to them, the team, or you.

---

## Building Trust

Trust is the foundation of everything. Without it, feedback doesn't land, delegation fails, and people leave.

### The Trust Equation

```
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation
```

| Component | What It Means | How to Build It |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Credibility** | They believe you know what you're talking about | Be competent. Admit when you don't know. Don't bullshit. |
| **Reliability** | They believe you'll do what you say | Follow through. Be consistent. Don't overpromise. |
| **Intimacy** | They feel safe with you | Be vulnerable. Keep confidences. Show you care about them as people. |
| **Self-Orientation** | (Divides trust) How much you're focused on yourself vs. them | Focus on their interests, not just yours. Listen. Don't make it about you. |

### Trust Builders

- Do what you say you'll do
- Admit mistakes openly
- Give credit; take blame
- Have their back in public
- Keep confidential things confidential
- Remember what matters to them personally
- Be consistent in your reactions and standards

### Trust Destroyers

- Saying one thing, doing another
- Taking credit for their work
- Throwing them under the bus publicly
- Sharing things they told you in confidence
- Playing favorites
- Being unpredictable or moody

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Avoiding Hard Conversations

**What it looks like:** Letting performance issues slide. Giving vague feedback. Hoping problems resolve themselves.

**Why it happens:** Conflict is uncomfortable. We want to be liked.

**The cost:** Problems fester. Others see the double standard. Good people leave.

**The fix:** Embrace that caring about someone means telling them the truth. Avoiding feedback isn't kind—it's selfish.

### Mistake 2: Solving Instead of Coaching

**What it looks like:** When someone brings a problem, you immediately solve it for them.

**Why it happens:** It's faster. You know the answer. It feels good to help.

**The cost:** They don't learn. They become dependent. You become a bottleneck.

**The fix:** Ask "What do you think?" before offering your view. Guide them to the answer instead of giving it.

### Mistake 3: Being the Hero

**What it looks like:** Jumping in to save the day when things go wrong. Staying IC when you should be enabling.

**Why it happens:** It's familiar. It's satisfying. It feels productive.

**The cost:** You don't scale. Your team doesn't grow. You burn out.

**The fix:** When you feel the urge to jump in, ask: "Is this the best use of my time? Who else could handle this? What would I need to give them to succeed?"

### Mistake 4: Treating Everyone the Same

**What it looks like:** Same management style for everyone. Fairness = identical treatment.

**Why it happens:** It feels fair. It's simpler.

**The cost:** Some people need more support, others more autonomy. One-size-fits-all serves no one.

**The fix:** Learn what each person needs. Manage the individual, not the role.

---

### Mistake 5: Neglecting Top Performers

**What it looks like:** Spending all your time on struggling performers. Assuming top performers are fine.

**Why it happens:** Squeaky wheel gets the grease. Problems demand attention.

**The cost:** Top performers get bored, feel undervalued, and leave.

**The fix:** Invest in your best people. Give them challenges, visibility, growth. Don't take them for granted.

---

### Mistake 6: Not Having a Point of View

**What it looks like:** Always asking the team what they think without sharing your own perspective. Avoiding taking a stance.

**Why it happens:** You want to be collaborative, not dictatorial.

**The cost:** Teams need direction. Indecision creates ambiguity and frustration.

**The fix:** Have opinions. Share them. Be open to being wrong, but don't be wishy-washy. "Here's what I think, and here's why. What am I missing?"

## The Manager's Calendar

How to structure your time:

| Activity | Suggested Allocation | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| 1:1s | 20-30% | Non-negotiable. Foundation of everything. |
| Team meetings / coordination | 10-15% | Alignment, decisions, communication |
| Strategic / thinking time | 10-15% | Planning, process improvement, long-term work |
| Cross-functional / stakeholder | 15-20% | Representing the team, unblocking, information flow |
| Available / buffer | 10-15% | Ad hoc conversations, unexpected issues |
| Your own development | 5% | Learning, reading, reflection |

If you're spending <20% of your time on people (1:1s + coaching + development), you're probably underinvesting.

## Final Thought

Management is a practice, not a destination. You will make mistakes. You will have hard conversations that go poorly. You will occasionally fail people who trusted you.

The goal is not to be perfect. The goal is to:
- Learn from every interaction
- Get a little better each week
- Care genuinely about the people you lead
- Be honest even when it's hard

If you do those things consistently, you'll be better than most managers—and that matters, because good management changes lives.
