# Engineering Scorecard

**Type:** Process
**Status:** [ ] In Progress

---

## Purpose

A consistent framework for evaluating engineers and grounding structured feedback conversations. The goal is to identify who's thriving, who's struggling, and what specific support each person needs.

## Context: Why Tenex Is Different

Tenex is a consultancy, not a product company. This changes what matters.

| Product Company Engineer | Consultancy Engineer |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Deep domain expertise | Rapid context switching |
| Long-term codebase owner | Deliverable handoff |
| Internal communication | Client-facing communication |
| Optimize for quality | Optimize for value/budget fit |
| One tech stack | Whatever the client needs |

The scorecard reflects what actually predicts success in a client-facing, fast-moving environment.

## The Five Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Delivery** | Gets things done reliably and on time |
| **Communication** | Surfaces issues early, with clients and team |
| **Ownership** | Self-directed problem solver |
| **Craft** | Technical quality and process rigor |
| **Capacity** | Managing load, sustainability |

---

## Dimension 1: Delivery

**What it measures:** Reliability in getting work done on time and to spec.

| Level | Behaviors |
|-------|-----------|
| **Struggling (1-2)** | Misses deadlines without early warning. Work requires significant rework after review. Commits incomplete or untested changes. Estimates are consistently off by 2x+. |
| **Meeting (3)** | Consistently delivers on committed timelines. Work is complete and tested before handoff. Flags risks and blockers before they become problems. Estimates are usually within 25% of actual. |
| **Excelling (4-5)** | Creates buffer for uncertainty, rarely misses. Proactively finds ways to deliver faster without sacrificing quality. Helps others get unblocked and meet their deadlines. Known as someone who "just gets it done." |

**Key question:** If I assign this person a task with a deadline, how confident am I it will be done?

---

## Dimension 2: Communication

**What it measures:** Proactive, clear communication with clients and teammates.

| Level | Behaviors |
|-------|-----------|
| **Struggling (1-2)** | Surprises you or the client with problems that were known earlier. Goes dark during complex work—hard to know status. Written updates are unclear or require follow-up questions. Avoids difficult conversations. |
| **Meeting (3)** | Surfaces blockers within 24 hours of identifying them. Provides clear status updates without being asked. Communicates appropriately with clients (knows when to loop in leadership). Asks clarifying questions rather than making assumptions. |
| **Excelling (4-5)** | Proactively identifies risks before they're problems and proposes solutions. Clients specifically praise their communication. Can translate technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders. Creates clarity for others on the project. |

**Key question:** Do I ever get surprised by something this person knew but didn't tell me?

---

## Dimension 3: Ownership

**What it measures:** Self-direction and independent problem-solving.

| Level | Behaviors |
|-------|-----------|
| **Struggling (1-2)** | Needs detailed instructions to start work. Gets stuck and waits rather than seeking solutions. Asks questions that could be answered with 5 minutes of research. Defaults to "what should I do?" rather than "here's what I'm thinking." |
| **Meeting (3)** | Takes initiative on assigned work without hand-holding. Researches problems independently before escalating. Proposes solutions, not just problems. Follows through on commitments without reminders. |
| **Excelling (4-5)** | Identifies work that needs doing and does it without being asked. Takes ownership of outcomes, not just tasks. When something falls through the cracks, they catch it. Acts like an owner of the project, not a task executor. |

**Key question:** Can I assign this person a problem (not a task) and trust they'll figure it out?

---

## Dimension 4: Craft

**What it measures:** Technical quality and adherence to engineering standards.

| Level | Behaviors |
|-------|-----------|
| **Struggling (1-2)** | Skips documentation, testing, or code review. Creates technical debt without awareness. Doesn't follow established patterns—reinvents unnecessarily. Code requires extensive review feedback on basics. |
| **Meeting (3)** | Follows team coding standards and patterns. Writes tests for new functionality. Documents work appropriately (PRs, tickets, handoff notes). Code reviews are straightforward—few major issues. |
| **Excelling (4-5)** | Raises the bar for code quality on the team. Catches issues in others' code during review. Improves processes and documentation proactively. Balances craft with pragmatism—knows when "good enough" is right. |

**Key question:** Does this person leave the codebase better than they found it?

---

## Dimension 5: Capacity

**What it measures:** Sustainable workload management and self-awareness about limits.

| Level | Behaviors |
|-------|-----------|
| **Struggling (1-2)** | Consistently overwhelmed—work quality suffers. Says yes to everything, then underdelivers. Can't articulate what's on their plate or prioritize. Shows signs of burnout (disengagement, cynicism, exhaustion). |
| **Meeting (3)** | Maintains sustainable pace—busy but not drowning. Can articulate current workload and priorities clearly. Pushes back or escalates when overloaded (before it's too late). Takes PTO and disconnects appropriately. |
| **Excelling (4-5)** | Models sustainable practices for the team. Helps others manage their load (pair programming, unblocking). Can absorb temporary surges without long-term impact. Creates systems to work efficiently, not just harder. |

**Key question:** Is this person's current pace sustainable for the next 6 months?

---

## Rating Scale

Each dimension: **1-5**

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Significant concern—needs immediate intervention |
| 2 | Below expectations—needs focused development |
| 3 | Meeting expectations—solid, reliable |
| 4 | Exceeding expectations—a strength |
| 5 | Exceptional—a model for others |

**Note:** A "3" is good. Most people should be 3s on most dimensions. 4s and 5s are genuinely exceptional.

---

## The Feedback Conversation

### Preparation (Before the Meeting)

1. **Engineer self-assesses** on all 5 dimensions (1-5 + brief notes)
2. **Manager assesses** independently
3. Both bring specific examples to support ratings

### Conversation Structure (~45-60 min)

| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **1. Self-Assessment Review** | 10 min | Compare ratings: Where do you agree? Disagree? Biggest gaps in perception are the richest discussion. Start with their perspective—listen first. |
| **2. Dimension Deep-Dive** | 25 min | Focus on 2-3 dimensions (not all 5 every time). Discuss specific examples, not generalizations. Use the feedback formula: *Observation → Impact → Question.* "I noticed [specific behavior]. The impact was [effect]. Can you help me understand what was going on?" |
| **3. Capacity Check** | 10 min | "On a scale of 1-10, where's your workload? 7 = sustainable." "What's taking more energy than expected right now?" "What would make next month easier?" |
| **4. Forward-Looking** | 10 min | Agree on 1-2 specific growth areas to focus on. "What support do you need from me?" "What will success look like in 30 days?" |

### After the Meeting

- Document key takeaways and commitments
- Follow up on agreed support within 48 hours
- Reference previous conversation in next session

---

## Cadence

| Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Regular 1:1s | Weekly (30 min) | Blockers, relationship, quick feedback |
| Scorecard review | Monthly | Structured assessment, trends over time |
| Career conversation | Quarterly | Longer-term growth, promotion readiness |

Monthly reviews create a paper trail and prevent surprises. By annual review time, you have 12 data points showing trajectory.

---

## How to Use This

### For Identifying Struggling Engineers Early

Watch for:
- Multiple 1s or 2s
- Declining scores over 2-3 months
- Capacity at 1-2 consistently

Intervene early. A structured conversation about "I'm seeing X, Y, Z—let's talk about what support you need" is better than waiting for a crisis.

### For High Performers

Look for:
- Consistent 4s and 5s
- Taking on increasing scope
- Helping others improve

Reward with visibility, interesting projects, and growth opportunities. Don't let them get bored.

### For Career Development

The dimensions map to growth:
- **Delivery + Craft**: Core competence, must be solid before advancement
- **Communication + Ownership**: Leadership potential, scope expansion
- **Capacity**: Sustainability, readiness for more responsibility

Someone who's 5/5 on Delivery and Craft but 2/2 on Communication and Ownership isn't ready for senior roles, even if their code is excellent.

## Red Flags & Patterns

| Pattern | What It Might Mean |
|---------|-------------------|
| High Craft, Low Delivery | Perfectionism, scope creep, prioritization issues |
| High Delivery, Low Craft | Cutting corners, technical debt accumulation |
| Low Communication across the board | Disengagement, fear, unclear expectations |
| Declining Capacity over months | Burnout trajectory, unsustainable assignment |
| High Ownership, Low Delivery | Overcommitted, saying yes to too much |
