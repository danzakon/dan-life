# Content

Social media content focused on AI engineering, technology, and business.

---

## Purpose

Build a presence in the AI/tech space by sharing insights that resonate. The goal isn't just to inform — it's to create content people actually want to engage with.

## Pipeline System

The full pipeline architecture, stages, skills, automation, and standards are documented in [pipeline/README.md](pipeline/README.md). That is the canonical reference for how content moves through the system.

```
INGEST → DIGEST → INTERVIEW (human) → DRAFT → REFINE (human) → STAGE → PUBLISH
```

Every idea that enters the system — thoughts, bookmarks, videos, research — becomes a **brief** with a tracked ID. Briefs are the atomic unit. No side channels.

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Posts

Weekly files containing multiple posts:

```
YYYY-W{NN}.md

Examples:
2026-W01.md
2026-W09.md
2026-W52.md
```

Year first, zero-padded week number. Sorts chronologically.

### Post File Format

```markdown
# Posts — 2026-W09

## [ ] The real reason AI projects fail

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Hook:** Most AI projects don't fail because of the tech.

## [x] Hot take on RAG

**Platform:** Twitter/X
**Posted:** 2026-01-24

{Post content here}

---
```

- `[ ]` — Not yet posted
- `[x]` — Posted (add date)

### Articles

One article per file in `articles/drafts/` or `articles/published/`:

```
YYYY-MM-{slug}.md

Examples:
2026-01-why-rag-fails.md
2026-02-agentic-second-brain.md
```

### Article Format

```yaml
---
title: Why RAG Fails in Production
status: draft | ready | published
published_date: 2026-01-24
platform: blog | medium | substack
---

{Article content here}
```

- `draft` — Still writing
- `ready` — Polished, waiting to publish
- `published` — Live (move to `published/`)

### Briefs

One brief per pipeline item:

```
YYYYMMDD-{SRC}-NNN.md

Examples:
20260307-BM-001.md
20260307-AD-003.md
```

See [pipeline/README.md](pipeline/README.md) for the full brief format and ID prefix table.

### Raw Files

Source material with ID prefix:

```
YYYYMMDD-{SRC}-NNN-{slug}.md

Examples:
20260307-BM-001-levelsio-pricing.md
20260307-YM-002-lex-fridman-transcript.md
```
