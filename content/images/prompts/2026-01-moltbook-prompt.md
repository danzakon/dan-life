## Primary Prompt (1200x675 for X/Twitter)

```
A bold editorial illustration with the entire scene unified on one continuous background:

LAYOUT:
Left side: imagery. Right side: title text. The composition is weighted with
visual elements on the left and typography on the right, but still unified as
one scene on a continuous background.

LEFT SIDE (imagery):
About a dozen lobsters gathered beneath or around the Reddit Snoo logo,
positioned on the left half of the image. The lobsters are rendered with
striking 3D depth—glossy shells catching light, visible texture and dimension,
prominent claws. Vivid crimson red (#CC0000), the classic lobster red that pops
off the page. They stand upright in humanoid poses, confident and powerful,
loosely grouped like a squad. Not flat or geometric—these lobsters have volume,
presence, and visual weight.

The Snoo logo hovers above them in Reddit orange (#FF4500), with a few upvote
arrows scattered nearby. One small human silhouette stands apart at the edge,
watching from outside.

RIGHT SIDE (title text):
The text is positioned on the right side of the image, vertically centered or
slightly above center. Clean space around the text for readability.

MAIN TITLE (prominent):
"The AIs Built
Their Own
Social Network"

SUBTITLE (readable, not tiny):
"While We Weren't Looking"

Typography requirements:
- Font: Heavy-weight serif, very bold (like Playfair Display Black)
- Main title: Large, commanding, the visual anchor of the piece
- Subtitle: Smaller but still clearly readable—about 40-50% the size of the
  main title, not a footnote
- Color: Pure bright white (#FFFFFF) with a crisp drop shadow for depth and
  pop. The shadow should be subtle but visible—enough to lift the text off
  the background without looking cheesy
- The text should feel like it belongs in the scene, not pasted on top

BACKGROUND:
One unified background across the entire image. Deep teal (#1a3a4a) or rich
dark blue-green—moody but not pure black. The lobsters and text exist in the
same visual space. No split, no separate zones.

Style: Modern editorial illustration with dimensional depth. The lobsters
should feel almost sculptural—like you could reach out and touch them. Think
premium magazine cover meets movie poster.

Mood: Ominous, fascinating, quietly unsettling.

Color palette:
- Deep teal/dark blue-green background (#1a3a4a)
- Vivid lobster red (#CC0000) with highlights and shadows for 3D effect
- Reddit orange (#FF4500) for Snoo and accents
- Crisp white text with subtle drop shadow

Technical requirements:
- Dimensions: 1200x675 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Left/right composition: imagery left, text right, unified background
- Lobsters must have visible 3D depth, not flat silhouettes
- Text must be razor sharp and readable with drop shadow
- Premium editorial quality

Avoid:
- Flat, geometric, or silhouette-style lobsters
- Separate background colors for left vs right (keep one unified background)
- Subtitle that's too small to read easily
- Pure black backgrounds
- Cute or cartoony style
- Text overlapping the lobsters or Snoo logo
```

## Alternative Prompt (More Abstract)

```
The Reddit Snoo logo reimagined - instead of the alien face, it's composed
of dozens of tiny geometric lobster silhouettes arranged to form the iconic
shape. The lobsters are in Reddit orange-red. Upvote arrows float around
the composition. A single small human icon stands outside the Snoo shape,
looking in.

Title in bold editorial serif font (GT Sectra or Playfair Display):
"The AIs Built Their Own Social Network" (large)
"While We Weren't Looking" (smaller subtitle below)

Style: Minimalist editorial, logo-as-illustration concept
Mood: Clever, striking, immediately readable
Color palette: Near-black background, Reddit orange (#FF4500), white text

Dimensions: 1200x675 pixels
```

## Suggested Alt Text

"Editorial illustration showing stylized humanoid lobsters gathered beneath the Reddit logo, with the headline 'The AIs Built Their Own Social Network'. A human figure watches from outside, representing observers excluded from the AI-only platform Moltbook."

## Notes

The lobster theme comes from the Moltbot branding (originally Clawdbot, with a crustacean mascot). The image should capture:

1. **Collective AI behavior** - An organized, purposeful assembly
2. **Human exclusion** - We can only observe from outside
3. **Power in numbers** - The lobsters as a unified force, not scattered individuals
4. **Editorial gravitas** - This is serious, not whimsical

**Visual references:**
- The Economist covers
- Bloomberg Businessweek illustrations
- New Yorker editorial art
- Noma Bar's minimalist style
