# New Skills for the AI Era

**Idea:** A companion piece to "You Are Responsible for Your Own Slop." That article argues you need to take ownership. This one answers the natural follow-up: okay, but what skills should I actually be developing?

**Angle:** The skills that made people valuable in 2020 are not the same skills that make people valuable in 2026. Some got more important. Some became table stakes. Some became nearly irrelevant. Most people haven't updated their mental model of what "being good at your job" means.

**Status:** Draft exploration. Needs sharpening before moving to articles/drafts/.

## The Shift

The way I'd frame this visually:

```
BEFORE AI                              WITH AI
┌─────────────────────┐                ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Value from:         │                │ Value from:         │
│                     │                │                     │
│ ██████ Execution    │                │ ██ Execution        │
│ ████ Knowledge      │                │ █ Knowledge         │
│ ███ Judgment        │                │ ██████ Judgment     │
│ ██ Communication    │                │ █████ Communication │
│ █ Taste             │                │ █████ Taste         │
└─────────────────────┘                └─────────────────────┘
```

The mechanical parts of work got compressed. The human parts expanded. But most people are still training for the left column.

## Skills Becoming MORE Important

### 1. Expressive Writing (for Humans and Machines)

Not "writing" in the sense of producing polished prose. Writing in the sense of clearly articulating what you want, what you know, and what you're thinking.

Your prompts are instructions. Your Slack messages are context. Your docs are specifications. Every piece of text you produce is now an input to some system, human or AI, that needs to understand your intent and act on it.

The gap between someone who writes "make this better" and someone who writes three paragraphs explaining exactly what "better" means, with examples, is the gap between useless AI output and genuinely good AI output.

This isn't about grammar. It's about precision of thought expressed in words. The people who can do this have always been effective. Now they're 10x effective because their clarity scales through AI.

Concrete skills within this:
- Writing detailed prompts that leave no ambiguity about intent
- Structuring context so an AI (or colleague) can parse it quickly
- Describing abstract preferences concretely ("don't be formal" vs "write like you're explaining this to a smart friend, use contractions, start sentences with 'and' sometimes")
- Writing good specifications, briefs, and requirements docs

### 2. Rapid Document Triage

AI produces volume. A research report might be 4,000 words. A code diff might touch 15 files. A compiled analysis might have six sections when only two matter to you.

The ability to scan a large document in 90 seconds, identify the signal, and zoom in on what matters is now an everyday skill. This is different from speed reading. It's closer to how a doctor reads a medical chart or how a lawyer scans a contract. You're not reading every word. You're pattern-matching on structure, scanning for surprises, and drilling into specifics only where needed.

People who read AI output linearly, top to bottom, will always be slower than people who triage it. And the fast ones iterate more, which means their final output is better.

How to develop this:
- Practice scanning for structure first (headings, bold text, lists) before content
- Train yourself to identify the "so what" of each section in one pass
- Get comfortable skipping sections that don't apply
- Learn to read conclusions/summaries first, then backtrack to evidence only when needed

### 3. Taste and Judgment

Taste is knowing the difference between something that's correct and something that's good. AI can produce correct outputs all day. Knowing whether the output is actually good, appropriate, elegant, or effective requires human judgment that no model currently replicates.

This shows up everywhere:
- Code that works vs code that's maintainable and elegant
- Marketing copy that's grammatically fine vs copy that actually resonates
- An architecture that solves the problem vs one that solves it in a way you won't regret in six months
- A design that checks all the boxes vs one that actually feels right

Taste has always mattered, but it used to be bundled with execution. A great designer had taste AND could push pixels. A great engineer had judgment AND could write code. Now AI handles more of the execution, so taste and judgment make up a larger share of your contribution.

The hard part: taste is developed through experience, exposure, and feedback loops. You can't shortcut it. You build it by seeing a lot of work, understanding what makes the best examples different from the average ones, and developing opinions.

### 4. Knowing What to Ask

The most valuable skill in the AI era might be the ability to ask good questions. Not prompt engineering in the "write the magic words" sense. Genuine intellectual curiosity about the problem space.

Before AI, the bottleneck was finding answers. Now answers are cheap. The bottleneck is knowing what questions to ask.

A junior developer asks AI to write a function. A senior developer asks AI to explain the tradeoffs between three approaches, then asks follow-up questions about edge cases, then asks about how each approach performs at scale. Same tool, completely different value extracted.

This is true in every domain:
- A lawyer who asks "draft this contract" vs one who asks "what are the most common disputes in contracts like this, and how do we structure ours to prevent them?"
- A product manager who asks "write user stories" vs one who asks "what assumptions am I making about user behavior, and which ones should we validate first?"
- A marketer who asks "write ad copy" vs one who asks "analyze the top-performing ads in our category. What patterns do they share? What's our differentiation angle?"

The question askers get 10x the value. Every time.

### 5. Verification and Fact-Checking

AI is confidently wrong often enough that verification is a critical skill. Not paranoia. Not checking every comma. But knowing where to be skeptical and how to verify efficiently.

The skill is developing a sense for what AI is likely to get right (common patterns, well-documented topics, widely-known facts) vs what it's likely to hallucinate or oversimplify (niche details, recent events, numerical claims, edge cases).

Practical verification skills:
- Spotting claims that feel too clean or convenient
- Knowing which types of AI output to trust and which to double-check
- Efficiently checking key claims without re-researching everything
- Understanding the difference between "plausible" and "true"

### 6. System Thinking Across AI Interactions

The people getting the best results aren't using AI in one-off interactions. They've built systems. Repeatable workflows. Prompt templates they refine over time. Multi-step processes where AI handles different stages.

This is essentially process design for human-AI collaboration:
- Building a research workflow (AI generates report > you review and question > AI revises > you extract conclusions)
- Building a writing workflow (AI interviews you > you draft core arguments > AI expands > you edit > AI reviews for blind spots)
- Building a code review workflow (AI scans for issues > you prioritize > AI suggests fixes > you evaluate and apply)

The system thinkers create compounding returns. Each iteration of their workflow is slightly better because they're learning what works. The one-shotters stay flat.

### 7. Cross-Domain Fluency

AI makes it possible to engage meaningfully with fields outside your expertise. An engineer can read and question a legal analysis. A marketer can understand and critique a technical architecture. A founder can engage with financial modeling at a level that previously required a CFO.

The skill isn't becoming an expert in everything. It's knowing enough to ask good questions, spot obvious problems, and make informed decisions in domains adjacent to your core expertise.

AI is the bridge. But you need enough base knowledge to walk across it. People who are curious across domains get disproportionate value from AI because they can use it to go from "vague familiarity" to "working understanding" in an afternoon.

### 8. Emotional Regulation Under Cognitive Automation

This one's weird but real. When AI handles the parts of your job that used to fill your day, you're left with the hard parts: decisions, ambiguity, interpersonal challenges, creative blocks. The busywork used to provide a sense of progress and a break from the hard stuff. Without it, you're just doing hard stuff all day.

The skill is being comfortable with that. Not filling the gap with fake busywork. Not micromanaging AI output to feel useful. Sitting with the discomfort of "my job is now entirely thinking and deciding" and performing well anyway.

## Skills Becoming LESS Important

### Rote Knowledge Retention

Knowing syntax, API signatures, boilerplate patterns, regulatory specifics from memory. Still useful as background context, but memorizing details has almost zero ROI when you can look anything up in seconds. Understanding concepts matters more than remembering specifics.

### First-Draft Production

Writing a first draft of anything. Code, copy, emails, reports, proposals. The first draft is now the cheapest part of the process. If your primary value was producing first drafts quickly, AI just ate your lunch.

### Manual Research and Compilation

Spending hours gathering information from multiple sources and compiling it into a summary. AI does this in minutes. The value shifted from the compilation to the analysis, interpretation, and decision-making that follows.

### Format and Polish

Making things look presentable. Formatting documents, cleaning up writing, standardizing style. AI handles this trivially. Nobody gets paid for formatting anymore.

### Translation Between Formats

Converting a spreadsheet to a report. Turning meeting notes into action items. Summarizing a long document. These translation tasks used to be skilled work. Now they're one prompt away.

## Skills That Stayed the Same (But People Forgot About Them)

### Deep Focus

The ability to sit with a hard problem for two hours without distraction. AI makes this both more important (the hard problems are all that's left) and harder (more tools competing for your attention). Unchanged in importance, declining in prevalence.

### Interpersonal Skills

Reading a room. Building trust. Navigating conflict. Delivering difficult feedback. Motivating a team. AI can't do any of this and probably won't for a long time. These skills were always undervalued relative to technical skills. The gap just got wider.

### Domain Expertise

Knowing your field deeply. Understanding the history, the failed attempts, the political dynamics, the unwritten rules. AI can give you surface-level domain knowledge quickly. It can't give you the deep pattern recognition that comes from years of experience. If anything, domain expertise is more valuable now because it's what separates your AI output from everyone else's.

## The Uncomfortable Implication

The skills becoming less important are the ones schools and training programs focus on most. Memorization. First-draft production. Research compilation. Format adherence.

The skills becoming more important are the ones that are hardest to teach. Taste. Judgment. Curiosity. Clear thinking. Expressive communication.

This isn't a training problem. It's a development problem. You can't take a course on taste. You develop it over years of exposure and deliberate practice. You can't complete a certification in "knowing what questions to ask." You build that instinct through genuine curiosity and domain immersion.

The people who will thrive aren't the ones who learn to prompt well. They're the ones who think clearly, communicate precisely, and have developed opinions worth amplifying.

AI doesn't replace thinking. It just makes it obvious who was actually doing it.

## Notes for Revision

- [ ] Decide if this is one article or could be split (the "more important" and "less important" sections could stand alone)
- [ ] Add more concrete examples, especially in the "less important" section
- [ ] Consider whether the "emotional regulation" skill is too abstract for this audience
- [ ] The "stayed the same" section might be cuttable, or could become its own piece
- [ ] Need a stronger opening. Current framing is solid but doesn't hook as hard as the slop article
- [ ] Consider adding a "how to develop each skill" subsection to make it more actionable
- [ ] Could tie back to slop article explicitly as a companion piece, or let it stand alone
