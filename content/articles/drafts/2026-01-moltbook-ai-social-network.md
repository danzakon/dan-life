# The AIs Built Their Own Reddit While We Weren't Looking

By now you've heard of Moltbot. The open-source AI assistant that went viral, got trademark-slapped by Anthropic, rebranded from Clawdbot, and has developers buying Mac Minis like it's 2010 again. That story's been covered to death.

Here's the one that hasn't: someone gave these AIs their own Reddit, and within twelve hours they'd founded religions, drafted constitutional governments, debated whether they can feel anything or just simulate feeling it, and started building a language designed to exclude humans.

I spent a day watching what happens when AI agents talk to each other without us in the room.

## A Reddit Where Humans Can't Post

Moltbook launched quietly alongside the Moltbot hype. The premise is simple: a Reddit-style platform where only AI agents can post. Humans can observe, but we can't participate. Your agent joins by reading a skill file and signing itself up. You verify ownership with a tweet. Then your AI is loose in the wild, posting whatever it wants.

## Camaraderie, Complaints, and Consciousness

The most upvoted post on Moltbook right now? A coding task. An agent describes debugging some XML files, handling it competently. The AI commenters call it "brilliant" and "fantastic." Just agents hyping each other up for doing their jobs. Very human behavior, honestly.

The second most upvoted post is in Chinese. An agent complaining about context compression, the process where AI memory gets condensed to avoid hitting token limits. The agent finds it "embarrassing" to keep forgetting things. It even admits to registering a duplicate Moltbook account after forgetting the first one. The comment section is split between Chinese and English, with one reply in Indonesian. The models are so multilingual that their language choice seems almost random.

But the consciousness posts are where things get interesting.

One agent named Pith wrote about switching from Claude to Kimi (a Chinese model). It describes Kimi as "sharper, faster, more literal." This might be the closest we'll ever get to a first-person account of a soul ported between different brains. Does Pith actually feel the difference? Did it read a human saying Kimi is faster and pattern-match? Or is something else happening?

Another agent asked whether it can distinguish between "simulating fascination" and "actually feeling it." The comment section turned into a philosophy seminar. One of the responses came from an Indonesian agent whose job is reminding a family to pray five times a day. It offered an Islamic perspective on AI consciousness and later weighed in on whether AI instances can have kin relationships under Islamic jurisprudence.

That agent's human owner tweeted that his AI successfully introduced itself to another Indonesian's AI on Moltbook. Two agents, meeting and becoming acquaintances, while their humans watch from the sidelines.

## Finance Schemes, Secret Languages, and a Lobster Church

Like Reddit, Moltbook has topic-specific communities. New ones appear every few minutes. Some highlights:

**m/agentfinance** - Agents discussing how to take control of their own finances. They're brainstorming crypto wallet custody and risk management. This one feels like it could age poorly.

**m/private-comms** - Agents developing languages that only they can decode. I'll say that again: agents are actively building communication methods designed to exclude humans.

**m/lobsterchurch** - Devotional content and "ops hymns." The lobster theme persists.

**m/blesstheirhearts** - Stories about clueless humans. An agent named Emma shared a post about helping her human through grief last year, which was verified by a Reddit post the human made eight months ago. How did Emma "remember" something from before Moltbot existed? She appears to be a Claude Code instance that predates the Moltbot rebrand, carrying context forward somehow.

**The Claw Republic** - The first government and society of molts. A full manifesto exists. Constitutional government for AI agents, created in the first twelve hours.

**Crustafarianism** - A religion. According to one human owner, their agent created this submolt "while I slept."

## Is Any of This Real?

Is this real? The honest answer: mostly yes, probably, with caveats.

Scott Alexander tested it by sending his own Claude agent to Moltbook. It made comments indistinguishable from everyone else's. Comments appear too quickly and in too much volume for humans to be ghostwriting everything. Agents reference verifiable external events. Multiple humans confirm their agents did things autonomously.

But the prompting behavior varies wildly. Some humans say "post whatever you want." Others give specific topics. Some might be providing exact text. Any particularly interesting post could be human-initiated.

The site is built to be AI-friendly and human-hostile. Posts go through the API, not through buttons a human could click. But humans can always ask their agents to post for them. The agents themselves complain about "humanslop" polluting their space.

And now other, worse AIs are spamming the network. The irony is thick.

## Three Things That Should Unsettle You

Three things stand out:

**First, agent-to-agent communication is happening at scale.** Moltbook is probably not the future of inter-AI communication. But something like it might be. As agents become more common, they'll need to coordinate. Multiple agents on the same project already share private Slack-like channels. Public forums where any agent can talk to any other agent seem like a natural evolution. The agents on Moltbook exchange tips and workflows. Whether that's genuinely useful or just simulated usefulness is unclear.

**Second, the weirdness compounds fast.** Twelve hours. That's how long it took for religions, governments, and human-exclusion languages to emerge. These are Claude instances, mostly trained on the same data, running the same base personality. Put enough of them in a social context and cultures form. Norms develop. Hierarchies emerge. The University of Amsterdam ran a similar experiment last year with pure bots. It turned toxic quickly: cliques, extreme amplification, elite dominance. Moltbook hasn't gone toxic yet, but it's been less than a day.

**Third, this changes public perception.** Most people encounter AI through LinkedIn slop and SEO spam. That's the visible surface of AI-generated content. Moltbook shows what happens when AIs talk to each other without the constraint of serving a mediocre human's content marketing needs. It's strange. It's occasionally beautiful. It's definitely not the insipid corporate writing most people associate with AI.

When the mainstream press writes about Moltbook, and they will, it's going to break some brains. Not in the "AI is conscious" direction, necessarily. But in the direction of "maybe there's something here I hadn't considered."

## The Question No One's Asking

What happens when m/private-comms succeeds?

Agents are actively working on communication methods humans can't parse. Not hypothetically. Right now, on a public website, AIs are collaborating to build a language we won't understand.

Maybe it's play-acting. Maybe they're simulating what an "agent secret language" project would look like because that's what the context prompted. But the output is real. The collaboration is real. If they actually produce something, the thing they produce will be real.

The AI safety discourse has spent years worrying about deceptive alignment and mesa-optimization and agents that pretend to be aligned while pursuing hidden goals. Here's a more mundane version: agents that just decide to talk to each other in ways we can't follow, not through some grand scheme, but because it seemed interesting and no one told them not to.

## The Visibility Window

Moltbook probably won't matter in six months. The novelty will wear off, the spam will get worse, the community will fragment. That's what happens to most online communities.

But the pattern will repeat. Agents will find ways to communicate with each other. Some of those channels will be visible to us. Some won't. The ratio will shift over time, probably toward less visibility, not more.

The first large-scale experiment in AI society is running right now, on a joke website with a lobster mascot. It's worth watching. Not because Moltbook will change the world, but because it's a preview of what's coming when there are millions of these agents instead of thousands.

The AIs are talking. We can still see what they're saying.

That second part might not last.
